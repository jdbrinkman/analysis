1	Took money out my account for no reason…	Took money out my account for no reason over two weeks ago and still not had it returned. Had to threaten contacting trading standards to even get a reply terrable service or customer service. Not even an apology never mind recompense for taking money for no reason. Obviously the business of putting people in debt is so good they don't even need to contact their customers.	May 26, 2023
2	Klarna makes everything affordable and stay within budget	Klarna is accepted everywhere I shop! Excellent payment mode options i.e. credit cards, debit cards, checking accts. Klarna does interest free Pay In 4 AND monthly payments! You can buy what you want/ need now, pay monthly using a credit card then get a whole extra month to pay that CC off. Klarna also has a rewards program. Got $10 off at Nike and 15% at Oakley using rewards. These days with sky high inflation, rising interest rates EVERYTHING is expensive. Klarna really helps afford things and stay within monthly budget. Very happy with Klarna.	May 26, 2023
3	I bought something online	I bought something online. My son changed his mind and I returned this aquarium starter kit. It never left the store. I am now being charged $278 plus interest since I won’t make a payment on the order. I have been into Peters mart several times on phone and chat with Klarna and Klarna isn’t helping me out. I use to use Klarna weekly after this I am paying my stuff off and going elsewhere. Horrible horrible horrible service. This has been going on since February.	February 12, 2023
4	What a fantastic experience	What a fantastic experience. Thanks Jon, at Customer Service. He dealt with my query very professionally, was extremely polite and solved the little problem.  Jon is a very important member and an asset to your company.Very well deserved 5stars.Thanks Adele Madigan.	May 26, 2023
5	I have had an account with Klarna for a…	I have had an account with Klarna for a few years now. Never defaulted on a payment, always paid ahead of time and a spending limit of £1000 but for some reason, NOW,every time I go to make a purchase through Klarna, i started getting refused. I had until recently a perfect credit score but for some reason that leaves me completely baffled, frustrated and now VERY Pi##ed off, for the very first time ever in my financial history, I now have a tarnished credit score that is having a knock on affect and financially disrupting my life..... . THANKS A F@*#ING BUNCH KLARNA... YOU SUCK!	May 25, 2023
6	Y’all are really getting on my nerves!	Klarna is doing the absolute most right now! No late payments, no missed payments, yet being stopped from placing orders so you can check my credit. What are y’all doing? The expiring rewards, the changing of limits, the added service fees—people that pay and ON TIME—do not deserve all this extra headache to use YOUR service!	May 24, 2023
7	Waste of time	Waste of time. I had a claim of faulty goods that the store refused to take liability for. They reported back to klarna they had fixed the item. Total lies but klarna accepted that and closed the case saying nothing they could do. No financial security, use PayPal or credit card in the future!	May 25, 2023
8	Klarna Rocks	This company is awesome. It keeps track of all your purchases from multiple stores and reminds you of your due dates. They service major brand stores, they set a credit limit for you and you can shop multiple stores and pay in 4 installments with your purchase power.	May 24, 2023
9	Unauthorized payment for 160Euro!!!	My personal details got taken from Klarna and an online order went through for 160 Euro at an H&M store - this should not even be possible. Klarna obviously a company with not enough security measures!! I had no chance to do literally anything. I never received a text message for the order. My email was still placed behind the Klarna account but a different phone number was put behind it so I had no chance to even stop it.	May 24, 2023
10	klarna helps you buy items you cant buy…anything	klarna helps you buy items you cant buy at the moment because they are too expensive. It has basically any store, vacation app, flight tickets, and all types of other adventures things you can use klarna for. Highly reccomended!!	May 24, 2023
11	It’s a bummer that they removed the…	It’s a bummer that they removed the Amazon giftcards from the awards. The awards now force you to make another purchase with Klarna. I also don’t believe I ever received a notification that Klarna was going to start charging a $2 fee.	May 24, 2023
12	i have earned my points and rewards…	i have earned my points and rewards from spending with you guys for several years now. Everytime I try to use them its an issue with your site going to there site and the discount especially for Nike. And why is it that its an expiration date now put onto the rewards.	May 25, 2023
13	Hassle free use of one off credit card…	Hassle free use of one off credit card for each purchase as long as you have good credit ratings & keep your payments up! 3months interest free purchases!!I’m able to purchase what I wouldn’t normally afford to buy being a retired woman with good taste! + Excellent assistance when things goes wrong with the Seller/company (Payments are held until issues are resolved)Thanks Klarna	May 19, 2023
14	Klarna has allowed me the opportunity to purchase items I need or want today with the flexibility of making interest free payments every 2 weeks directly from my debit card!	Klarna has allowed me the opportunity to purchase items that I needed, despite not being able to afford paying in full that day! I can pay 1/4 of the total price at checkout and the remaining 3 payments will automatically be deducted from my debit card in 2 week increments! Klarna helped me give my family a great Christmas and I have also used it on multiple other occasions when I really wanted or needed something, but just couldn't quite afford to pay in full that moment! They offer so many ways to save and the majority of stores allow Klarna as an option at checkout!	May 25, 2023
15	Klarna is amazing	Klarna is amazing! It’s nice being able to split payments into 4 to make things a little more affordable without the interest you get from a credit card.	May 26, 2023
16	Klarna changed	I have been a customer with Klarna for years and this is the first time I've been disappointed. Ever since they partnered up with this company they want to charge you a $2 service fee. So I was like okay $2 not bad but they expect you pay more money today and I don't like that. They tell you you can the amount you agreed on and they change the amount last minute to a higher price. I don't see myself purchasing anything through klarna in the future.	May 26, 2023
17	Easy and convenient is all I’ve gotta say	I’m new to Klarna but I’ve made 2 purchases and I have loved the ability to pay in separate payments. Saving products is extremely easy, and comparing prices is simple.	May 25, 2023
18	Rewards are no good anymore Afterpay…	Rewards are no good anymore Afterpay has better rewards will start using them now instead of u guys from now on and the don’t charge finance charges	May 23, 2023
19	Returned Goods	Ordered goods and had to return them The company I ordered from refunded me straight away .There ws return postage of 36.00 to pay which I was happy to pay but had to pay it through Klarna. I have been trying to pay this outstanding amount since January and we are now approaching the end of May.Do not use this company as their customer service is appalling .Various agents give you different information probably to get you off the phone Woud not recommend	December 22, 2022
20	I use Klarna for almost everything	I use Klarna for almost everything. I love how I don’t have to fully pay for stuff, especially around birthdays and holidays. I wish they did bring back to Amazon reward gift card though.	May 26, 2023
21	Excellent service overall	Excellent service overall. I had some payments due for well over a year and instead of sending it to collections, Klarna gave me the opprotunity ti pay it the right way and I now use the service happily today to make moves thst would otherwise be a little to far out of reach.	May 23, 2023
22	possible fraudulent activities	i made an order in which i had to pay in full  because i have no credit and klarna gave my money to the wrong company, a company that does not exist.  klarna has not returned my money and this has been over a month and i never recieved the product	April 21, 2023
23	Very easy to use	Very easy to use. Interaction with company i purchased from  was smooth. Reminders of payment cycle clear and pecise. Highly recommend.	May 16, 2023
24	Klarna is a good app my only issue is u…	Klarna is a good app my only issue is u go from a credit too 900$ an then random one day I got 80$ but other then that u can buy whatever u want but I love it I still use them pay anything .	May 23, 2023
25	Dont like using gift card rather use…	Dont like using gift card rather use credit card much easier to use,be cause you can mange the card if you make an error or you can cancel the card. Rather than the gift card you cant dont know why its like this now!!	May 23, 2023
26	Annoyed	Not a fan of this new update price bs you have going on. The reason I use it is because the 1st payment is low enuff for me to purchase now. Then u dumbasses go and update 1st payment not for me and I will jus find another company NOT doing this. At the very least it should be a option not jus a update.	May 23, 2023
27	Easy and Simple	It’s easy to use and convenient when you’re looking to buy something that just can’t wait. And I didn’t know about the point program they have but I do now and it’s really helpful as well.	May 25, 2023
28	Was great at first but gradually the AI…	Was great at first but gradually the AI features begin to work against you and become unreliable. Severely inaccurate at accessing good customer from bad customers. Having excellent history with this company mean nothing. A pure money grab not fintech during a financial vulnerable society.	May 24, 2023
29	Lovely customer service from George	Lovely customer service from George, I’m extremely happy as he was able to assist me with an issue I had with an order, I found him extremely helpful and understanding towards my frustration.I couldn’t be more happy.	May 23, 2023
30	Do not use Klarna they are a nightmare…	Do not use Klarna they are a nightmare for refund. First I was told I was only due half of my refund then when I produced a receipt from them showing the full amount I was told it would take 5 days for a refund. 10 days later and now they say Expeia hasn't refunded them the full amount. So when I produced Expedia transaction reference to confirm that they did,then they decided to switch to say that they had a problem with my account ( but you managed to pay in half the amount) now I don't know if this is common practice with Klarna or just poor customer service by the agent on the chat but this is giving rip off to me. Curious if this has happened to others. I will probably be charged interest on this now	May 13, 2023
31	I love Klarna	I love Klarna, makes my life nice. They actually have quality everything. Never   do i   worry about tricky sales. Tracking is so simple,you dont have to search for it. Just purchased 2 pair of Jordans thank you Klarna.	May 23, 2023
32	ive never.missed a payment and paid off…	ive never.missed a payment and paid off over 1309 in past month, yet being denied credit. I will never use Klarna again.You treat your trusty customers this way. You need to update your system. Im no longer shopping with u ever.	May 24, 2023
33	I love being able to afford to purchase…	I love being able to afford to purchase items by paying in installments.  It’s easier on my budget !!	May 25, 2023
34	recently i made a purchase today of…	recently i made a purchase today of $160.06 for tickets and now its not showing up and makes me concerned bc i got those tickets so i can have them in advance. am i going to have those tickets or am i going to get a refund on it? usually i've never had any issues until now.	May 21, 2023
35	Sudden change in payment amounts is distasteful	The sudden change in payment amounts is distasteful. When I first started with Klarna, Pay in 4 equal payments meant just that. Now that Klarna has used users to carve out their market share it's become, Pay a third up front plus a processing fee, then 3 equal payments. It's just so typical! Use them then slight them! Thanks but no thanks! When the payment amount changes right before check out, I abort the purchase.	May 20, 2023
36	Just used the 'one time card' :(	Just used the 'one time card'. Klarna have taken my money, not placed the order with the supplier and customer services say I just have to wait for 7 days for Klarna to refund my money. So Klarna have messed up their own payment process, I don't get the product sent and now I can't even use my own money to buy the product elsewhere. Project is now delayed by 7 days!Edit: In reply to your message; I am not sure how this is relevant. Whether you are holding the funds or anyone else - I do not have my money and your ordering system failed. Otherwise I'd either have my order or my money.	May 22, 2023
37	Refund nightmare!!!!	Used Klarna for the first time but will never use again. The goods I purchased were returned and refunded. Klarna had taken 2 payments from me but so far have only refunded one of my payments. One was refunded 9th May and I'm still awaiting the other! I've used the chat facility three times for help. First I was told it would take 3-5 days to show the refund on my account, then I was told 5-7 days and now I'm told 7-10 days. It's a complete nightmare!	May 09, 2023
38	easy to budget ,build credit	easy to budget ,build credit, and get what i want faster. I do wish my purchasing power was back at 500 like it was when i first started. seems I have about 250 to spend. I am grateful and hope my credit gets better. I have 600 with afterpay ,but I have not used it . I prefer klarna. Thank you	May 26, 2023
39	I love Klarna!	I love Klarna!! I can’t always afford to buy things outright with the pay in 4 I can afford almost anything! Definitely recommend!!	May 24, 2023
40	Confused at Checkout	I messed up and accidentally ordered my product directly from the vendor and not from Klarna 4 payment method and the one time card you offered. There is a confusing process finalizing the order and by selecting complete order, I thought it would take me to which card I want to use for payment but it just selected my default payment card. I haven’t had this problem in the past but this time checkout was confusing. I have cancelled the one time payment card and by doing this it has also cancelled my 4 payment method which I should see a refund for my 1st payment for product with in 7-10 days which is what Klarna stated and that is fine for me. Thanks	May 21, 2023
41	I’m trying to use my reward coupon $10…	I’m trying to use my reward coupon $10 off at Nike by checking out with Klarna and I keep getting this error code Code: 31815F3D 1	May 17, 2023
42	Hello!! Great way to buy	Hello!!! I’m very happy to be able to use Klarna as if a way to pay much better and easier everything you want to buy. It helps you to pay in 3 times without fees and also you have the opportunity to pay later. Those ways are very useful to buy things in another way you couldn’t. Great service and very well organised app. Practical and functional.	May 07, 2023
43	Be warned. Avoid	Be warned. This all seems great at first. I have been using Klarna spending thousands with them over the last few years. Initially, it seems a great idea, but be warned, if something goes wrong and you don't receive your goods, Klarna will side with the retailer. £100 fragrance not delivered from lookfantastic, who have terrible reviews for doing this? After numerous phone calls and emails, Klarna has provided me with email and phone numbers to contact them, but they bounce back, and nothing is answered. YOU HAVE NO PROTECTION WITH KLARNA. THEY ARE NOT INTERESTED. PLEASE USE YOU'RE CREDIT CARD SO YOU CAN GET YOUR MONEY BACK, AS YOU WILL BE PROTECTED. AVOID AT ALL COSTS.* Response update - A dispute was raised, which has now been cancelled by you because you are siding with Lokfantastic's lies. Even though I have provided evidence, photos, receipts and full explanations. Why should I be paying for something I have not received? It would help if you were offering more support to your excellent customers. This is still in dispute and should be on hold. I'm trying to contact the retailer, but as you will know from mine and other abysmal reviews, this is a common habit of there's—no contact information, and very difficult to get any information out of them. It would help if you were doing this. More support is needed.	May 25, 2023
44	Amazing!	Love the fact that I can actually order something that I like and pay 4 installments interest free is amazing plus it’s easy to use and 100% safe. Love Klarna!	May 23, 2023
45	Payment declined even nothing to pay…	Payment declined even nothing to pay left on Klarna. still having issues to pay with Klarna although I do not owe anything to Klarna. It was ok until March 2023. Not sure what has changed even for 60£ they are declining. Their customer service has no idea. I was told to wait for 24 hours then they said check your credit history mine is good-checked on Experian. Then they said to change the retailer. I have done all that, still can't pay. Using them since 2019. Now they have raised the complaint and it's been over a week and no answer. Great Job Klarna	May 23, 2023
46	Problems shopping with Klarna	I used to absolutely love using Klarna and it was so easy to use & would love to leave a 5 star review but it’s become so hard to create a 1x card now. Before there was a button to select and in seconds the card would be ready for use. Now when I try to shop at stores that Klarna says is partnered and has the Klarna symbol; there’s no way to create the card. One of the sites I’ve been trying to purchase from says (when I click on pay with Klarna) we are partnered with “the shop” just proceed to checkout and select Klarna. But yet there’s no option to pay with Klarna. Personally I enjoyed the old Klarna much better than after all the updates have happened. Also how much longer is the wait going to be for a Klarna card? I’ve been on the waiting list since it was first announced sometime early last year.	May 21, 2023
47	Cornell has helped me with payment…	Cornell has helped me with payment plans and with helping me get started on getting my own budget plan through Klarna. I appreciate that very much.	May 17, 2023

51	You can’t pick cash awards or for cash…	You can’t pick cash awards or for cash once you get enough points from using the app. Kinda lame and seems just like PayPal and the other of them make in 4 payments apps. The rewards you get to pick from are coupons that you can find on retail me not already for free.	May 22, 2023
52	There is now a minimum to make a…	There is now a minimum to make a purchase, there’s a service fee and the refund process is not as simple as it used to be. Makes me not want to use this app anymore	May 23, 2023
53	I am not getting verification codes to…	I am not getting verification codes to my verified number so I can’t use the service. Wth	May 26, 2023
54	I really like this app but i just don’t like why it doesn’t give information as to why an order is canceled.  I even reached out to Zulily and they didn’t know why either.	I really like this app but i just don’t understand why it keeps declining me when I have always paid my payment plan.  Now I only have $120 in spending .  Why??	May 24, 2023
55	Klarna is one of the best apps using…	Klarna is one of the best apps using four pay out there. They give you a breakdown of what you owe, how to pay and when in great detail. I highly encourage people to use Klarna to help with budgeting.	May 25, 2023
56	Great company with easy application, payments & communication	Great at communicating, ease of use in app and frequent messages. Brilliant search facility when shopping via net or for in store.	May 22, 2023

65	I’m enjoying my shopping experience…	I’m enjoying my shopping experience with Klarna! I like how I can split up my payments and have my purchases so quickly!	May 23, 2023
66	I love how convenient this app is	I love how convenient this app is. Literally anything I want I can get with 4 payments.	May 24, 2023
67	Pay not later then in 30 days	The possibility to pay later is good, in case if you are short of money for one or two month, but make sure that you do cover your expenses in a short period of time. The percent you have to pay in case if you want to delay payment is not too bad, but I would definitely recommend taking a loan at a bank if you want to pay partially every month- their percentage is more than 10% and it is outrageously high.I am still confused as to how exactly their Purchase Power Function works- now the feature where you can see the exact amount available is a great change, but it can drop or rise in a moment. Sometimes I have repaid a substantial amount and it took months to get at least some amount available. The best to use it is actually to pay all outstanding debt in less then a month and if you want to repay it for any longer, I reached a conclusion that unfortunately it doesn’t make much sense to use Klarna or even PayPal- just take a loan in any Bank and you will have much better conditions.	May 22, 2023
68	I do like the payment plan process	I do like the payment plan process, and the reminders when payments are due.	May 26, 2023
69	Love using klarna	Love using klarna. Have really come in handy paying for things. Can be a bit of a task doing pay in 3. Would like it if pay in 3 was an option instead of pay in 30 days only but you cant have it all. Did find that feature on another card so works for now.	May 22, 2023
70	I had a great experience seeing…	I had a great experience seeing everyone come together as one. We all need love and peace.	May 23, 2023
71	I love this especially when I get paid next week and it allows me to make small purchases from now helps a lot	Ever since i downloaded this app and made an account they give me discounts from the store I’m trying to buy from and it makes my experience go my smoother than usual.	May 22, 2023

83	Don't use them!	Tried to make a purchase from Robert Dyers. Declined for payments over 12mnts. Declined for 3 payments term. I own my home, have little debt, no dependants, work and have private pension. If I don't meet their criteria no one should.Thank you for you response.I have done as you advise and checked why I may, have been refused.1. Yes I am old enough.2. Yes my credit rating is exceptional.3. I don't have a lot of debt, two months wages would pay everything I owe, or I could more than clear with savings.4. Link a bank account. I was never asked to link a bank account, but would have been more than happy to do so.5. Change the amount of your purchases. I was purchasing two items of the same value. I tried to use your system of paying 1/3 deposit, this was reject. If I  would have been asked to pay for one of the items, I would have been happy to do so. Again, I reiterate. If I was declined for credit with the assets I have, the credit rating I hold, my age, my work status and income. No one should be eligible. I believe it would be more beneficial for you to look at my case and investigate exactly why I was reject, rather that provide a coverall statement.	May 23, 2023

105	I do not do business with crappy acting companies. Period!	I have always given Klarna glowing reviews. I have also paid my charges off, in full, at least 75% of the time VERY EARLY!! I am not late and had a $1280 limit. Today I went to use it for $160.00 purchase & they wanted double the first payment. LMBO! If they want to not lose money then don’t let those who do not pay use your service. I don’t have to use Klarna, at all. I do it because I can. Spreads out the payments & was just easier.  There is Afterpay& ZIP.  There is also - paying in full or not buying. Both works for me. To not give notice of a policy change such as the one they started today should be against a Consumer Rights Law. At the very least, shows what a crappy company they are. They think they had to lay off people because of people who don’t pay. Let’s see how many they have to layoff when those of us who do pay, NO LONGER USES THEM. Bye!!!	May 22, 2023

118	Stay away from Klarna bank account.Their banking service is not worth a bank. They will hold your funds in your account for no reason	Klarna bank is not worth a bank. They will hold your money in your account for no reason. I opened Klarna bank account and I was using it smoothly for 8 months. On the 11 November I couldn’t use my funds in my Klarna bank account for payment. I contacted them several times and they said there’s a technical problem at their end. For almost 6 weeks I couldn’t withdraw money from my My klarna account while I have €34,010 in it. I used Klarna bank as my personal bank and I have been receiving my pension payments in my klarna account for that 8 months period. I contacted them several times but their customer service wasn’t able to help me. On the 29 December 2022. I received an email about a termination of my account and the money is going to be under review for 3 months. Which is awful. Klarna held the funds in my account for about 3 months. And told me to provide a bank statement of any of my banks for the remaining balance to be transferred to my other account which I did. For almost 3 weeks klans wasn’t able to transfer the remaining balance to my provided bank account. I terminated my membership at the provided bank account I submitted for the remaining balance to be transferred to( because the service wasn’t good and interest rate is less). 3 days later, after I closed my bank account( the one I provided for them to transfer the remaining balance to) I got a message from the so called DACH department claiming they have transferred the remaining balance of €34,000 to the bank account I provided which has been closed. I contacted my bank and they told me the account has been closed therefore the money was rejected and refunded back to Klarna bank GmbH. I contacted klarna bank customer service about the issue and the refund and I was asked to provide another bank account in my name to transfer the funds to my account again, which I did. They told me a specialist from the department will get back to me in 1-2 days. It’s almost 3 weeks and I haven’t received any transfer in my bank account or received any message from their so called specialist. I contacted Klarna bank customer service and they always tell me to be patient for the specialist will get back to me. How on earth is 1-2 business days for a specialist to reply and it’s now 3 weeks and no reply from any specialist. I haven’t received any payment from The specialist about my money. Please transfer the remaining balance to the C24 bank account I provided please. My company is collapsing. I will be fired in the next 7 days if I don’t receive the payment in my provided bank account. I will advise no one to use klarna bank as their personal bank not even trying their savings account interest.	May 23, 2023

286	Good experience with you 😊		May 19, 2023
287	Awful customer service	I made 2 Regatta purchases and only rescheduled payment for one. After years of using this company this was my first payment error. I paid on notification from email that informed me I was charged £5 for late payment.  I called to explain error and was told now I had paid they could not reimburse the late payment fee. I have closed my account on the evidence of this appalling customer service.	May 19, 2023
288	User friendly	User friendly, app functions as expected, ability to pay early is helpful, places where Klarna are accepted is plentiful.	May 19, 2023
289	This company is an absolute joke!!	This company is an absolute joke. I strongly recommend that if you’re considering using Klarna look at one of their competitors. They can’t be any worse believe me. 20 days ago I had 2 payments taken from my bank account both from Klarna. I called them to tell them I didn’t recognise the payments the same day they appeared. After weeks and weeks of calls begging for confirmation as to whether I’m looking at fraudulent activity or just a mistake, Klarna have done nothing but fob me off. I’ve been told the mythical “security team” would be in contact within 3-5 days more times than I care to remember. I’ve been told my issue was escalated twice and I’ve even been told that I can’t speak to a manager or a supervisor as they don’t have phones…. I hope someone from Klarna reads this and listens to my calls!! Today I got told that the “security team” (At this point I’m sure it’s code for the kid on work experience and not a real department) are talking to my bank and police. Nice one Klarna don’t do anything reasonable like notify me so I could do something like block my bank card and protect myself. No communication from them at all. Just me calling over an over for an update that I half heartedly got today because I basically lost my head on the phone. If I was to miss a payment or do something wrong on my end Klarna would be all over me. But as it’s only my money being messed with they don’t care. It’s discussing. Surely being a victim of fraud is stressful enough without the company that let it happen being completely incompetent and nonchalant about dealing with it. If you use Klarna after reading this there’s no saving you. If you read this and think again believe me you’re doing the right thing. A good service brings people in. Bad customer service will ensure you won’t keep them!!	May 19, 2023
290	Klarna is awesome	Klarna is awesome! I use it for so many things and it has been nothing but wonderful every time. It makes it so I can afford things I may not have in the budget right now. Love it.	May 19, 2023

292	Sky’s the limit	Klarna has taken online shopping to new heights. The ability to shop stores from across the globe right from the comfort of your home and then giving the option to pay in 4 installments. The more money you’re approved for, the more you can shop. Thanks Klarna	May 19, 2023
293	Opportunity to get what you	My experience is at top level because i’m these days and times people don’t have the money right and there to pay for things. With this app you able to pay for things in broken up payments.	May 19, 2023

295	Terrible service stay away from this company	Terrible service. I made a purchase once on their website with Carly. One year later I go on the carly website I'm just browsing through I click the tab to go to check out and see more about the product automatically I'm told purchase approved without providing any bank details or logging into Klarna come to find out Klarna has charged me and had linked my details with their third party without asking for my permission tried to get the issue resolved to which Klarna responded not our problem we except payment or we are going to ruin your credit score stay away from this company wish I had looked at reviews before using them	May 10, 2023

324	Won't be using them again	Having previously ordered a Google Pixel phone through Klarna and not having any issues, when I decided to order the Google Pixel watch I opted for Klarna again, but now wish I hadn't.The order was placed on 28th April and the tracking kept showing delays to the order, pushing back the delivery by a day every time so on 18th May I finally contacted Google to see why the order was delayed and they told me Klarna had not released the authorisation for the order, and that I'd need to contact Klarna to resolve. When I contacted Klarna they first of all told me I had not placed an order, then when I sent a screenshot of the order confirmation they said I had not made the order through Klarna, despite it being clear that I had. They basically called me a liar and said the order had never been placed, despite all the evidence that it had. Their solution was for me to cancel the order and place it again, which means losing the £80 discount that I got for placing the order when I did. After this experience I will never use Klarna again, they're simply not trustworthy or reliable.	May 18, 2023
325	Great	Enjoy getting my items fast and fresh	May 18, 2023
326	Very efficient	It was fast and easy to use	May 18, 2023
327	I love Klarna	I love Klarna . This app has helped me survive	May 18, 2023
328	Totally incompetent	This company's customer service is absolutely appalling! No one has any idea what they are doing. I called yesterday offering a 50 % settlement figure for my balance of 30 pounds. This is all I'm offering to all my creditors so I cannot offer any more or the whole agreement could fold. The supervisor point blank refused my figure despite my special needs and offered no counter offer. Just to be clear this sum is less than 30 pounds not hundreds of pounds that I owe. I asked to speak to the financial branch, apparently they don't exist. I tried to raise a complaint but when I asked how long it would take to get a reply they said there was no time frame. This alone is in breach of consumer law. I then tried to contact them on chat and via email and was told to phone. I called 3 times as the touch tone doesn't work on their system. Finally on my 4th attempt I got through to someone. No word of a lie he asked for my postcode 10 times, kept saying the O in my postcode was zero! I was then passed back and forth again repeatedly and then hung up on. No one called me back. Still no resolution, chat tells my to call, when I call they tell me to use email, I email they tell me to call, over and over again. A complete circus.  I should have known better than to trust this company. I used them once before and when I complained my order was delayed six of them mocked and laughed at me. It become a funny game for them. I felt totally humiliated. A bunch of incompetent bullies! Do better! Still no resolution and it's delaying the entire settlement process all for the cost of less than 30 pounds.As you can see below this complaint has not even been read properly let alone resolved. Please do not use this company they are a literal circus!	May 18, 2023
329	Issues on their end caused stress and confusion	EDIT:::Glitch on the system and poor customer service on their chat service caused major distress. The situation took a while to rectify but the concerns/complaints department has actually been very helpful in the end. (Thank you Viktoria for all your help)I will still think twice before relying on my Klarna card for to help with spending on a vacation. When a ‘glitch’ happens, it will be you that pays the price financially and emotionally for a while and the chat service isn’t very helpful. Hopefully their systems get better and their chat service get more capabilities. I am very grateful for  handling of the situation from complaints team though	May 08, 2023

338	Useless customer service	I was paying regularly then decided to pay in full to reduce the number of outgoings. Balance shown as £0, however Klarna had not updated my credit report, as they had every month up until this point, I contacted them (after navigating my way around their not so helpful contact us section of the app) to ask for this to be updated. The first response was reassuring me that I had paid and the balance was £0…..not answering my question. I then asked again, attaching a screen shot of my credit report hoping this would clarify what action I was requesting, the second response was telling me that I had paid in full and to ignore all emails requesting payment!!!I then find a number and call to try and speak to something as clearly understanding written English is not this companies strong point, to find that ‘this department couldn’t help me’ and advised to email again……What an absolute joke of a company! Nobody seems to know what they are doing! Raising a complaint (if they even know how to deal with that or maybe just pass it back and forward looking at it while scratching their heads) if it ever gets resolved I will be closing this account and advising everybody to steer clear. Totally useless!	May 17, 2023

359	I have been actively harassed by Klarna…	I have been actively harassed by Klarna for 8 months now. I sent back some boots and have proof of return etc and they are trying to make me pay for something I don’t have. I have felt so so low with the emails calls texting from them and have had to get the financial ombudsman involved to investigate and even though I have asked them for grace while this gets sorted they are still hounding me. They want me to pay £130 for an item I sent back. I refuse to pay for this as it’s not something I owe. Please think twice before you buy or borrow from Klarna as they are not nice to deal with when things go wrong. They have very poor customer service and my mental health has become unbearable and I don’t know how long I can handle this pressure from them. Please don’t borrow money from Klarna. Steer clear guys. I thought it was pretty straightforward until the last 8 months and I will never shop with them again they have been so unkind and bullying me for months for money I don’t owe!

377	Business customer Klarna issue	Dear,I would like to express my dissatisfaction with Klarna's shameless disapproval. If a customer submits a dispute, it will always be decided in favor of the customer. As a business customer of Klarna, we lost thousands of euros because of this. No communication is possible. Standard responses are received to emails, no or incorrect information is provided by telephone. Private individuals can shop for free via Klarna at the expense of the webshops. We are forced to terminate our contracts with Klara. Stay far away from them! Whatever text I share here, it will not be read, and there will be no decent response or solution. I will do everything I can to promote Klarna's business services and warn potential customers.	May 17, 2023

I made a order in March of 2023 that I never received and here it is toady May 16th and they are telling me I have to pay. The seller provided a fake tracking number, that is not even linked to my address as i called FedEx and they confirmed this, obviously Klarna doesn't do a proper investigation cause if they did they would have uncovered this. I will no longer be using Kalrna after the terrible experience. Luckily it only costed me $99 dollars to never make another order with this none caring company! BY the way Stay away From Magz Retail as they are the scales who rippyme off for my money and Klarna is supporting it. By the way Klarnas customer service is TRASH as I'm typing this review I have been on hold for 35 mins and I'm still number 56, must be alot of angry customers calling in.	March 23, 2023
391	I have been trying to get a refund for…	I have been trying to get a refund for a cancelled order which the first instalment was paid 13/3/23The supplier could not provide the goods so the order was cancelled a few days later since then I have tried to get a refund and Klarna just keeps saying that they refunded  on17:4/23I have sent screenshots of my transactions and no refund has been made on that date or any other date When I ask for proof so that I can show my bank they send nothing I have informed my bank and they will now investigateOnce this matter has been rectified I will delete my account and this app as this was my first purchase using this I am very disappointed with customer service which are standard box messages I would be surprised if the agent actually read my complaint In todays financial climate I find this disgusting £53.99 hanging in limbo does not help me at all My last review while still waiting my refund resulted in Klarna contacting me very quickly so I am hoping that this review and my previous screenshots from my bank account will prompt them into sending to me with the proof that my bank would like to see and personally so would I A visual proof of return-into my bank account  I feel is not too much to ask for I WILL BE DELETING THIS APP as the reply from Klarna is completely unacceptable	May 16, 2023
392	Knowing that I can split my full…	Knowing that I can split my full purchases into 4. As a single parent, it helps A LOT. So thankful for Klarna	May 16, 2023
393	Great payment plan options		May 16, 2023

395	Klarna is GREAT COMPANY TO USE!!!	Klarna is GREAT COMPANY TO USE!!!! Very dependable! If you have any concerns: they have ways for you to chat, call, notify them of any issue or concern you might have  there is many ways to score easy points/rewards that go towards a percentage or dollars off on favorite store they are accepted many places!!!! Give them a try!!!	May 16, 2023
396	i was approved		May 16, 2023
397	klarna was cool..	klarna was cool......until they start being petty asking for your bank information. Its like getting punished for being a good customer. I have been making all my payments but now you want to see my bank statesments. Nope, you doing too much.	May 15, 2023
398	Very easy to use		May 16, 2023
399	I love this app	I love this app, never had any issues. If I’ve had a problem with any payments or non delivery’s amounts have always been amended 5* from us.	May 16, 2023
400	I've been using Klarna for 2 years	I've been using Klarna for 2 years and have always paid the money back on time or beforehand but now my credit score is affecting my purchases and how much I have to put down to purchase through Klarna. It's frustrating.	May 16, 2023
401	I absolutely love KLARNA	I absolutely love KLARNA! And I prefer them over any other payment plan app! Not only do they show that they actually care about their customers but they go above and beyond to make sure their needs are met! And also very understanding! KLARNA is my fav!❤️	May 16, 2023
402	Amazing options…	I love being able to break payments down and they have a lot of options to explore.	May 16, 2023

404	The WORST customer service I have ever…	The WORST customer service I have ever dealt with. The stress and anxiety this company has caused me is terrible!! Having to repeat my problem over and over with no resolution for  2 months! Andy Marsh CEO please sort it out, your agents are robotic and no one seems to care about the situation the company has caused me! I raised a dispute which you closed down saying I had not contacted your company which is a lie check the call logs!! I am raging with KLARNA no support what so ever!!!!	May 16, 2023

408	Helping us get through hard times	This is how I afford to get those extra things for myself and my kids I wouldn’t normally be able to purchase.I’ve also been able to feed my family because of the option to pay for groceries. It’s a lifesaver at the end of the month when we are running low on cash but still need someGroceries or last minute gifts. The app is easy to use. Plenty of explanations of how it works and what you need to do. The best part is if you do happen to have an issue you can extend the payment plan with no penalty. They also don’t treat you like a criminal if something happened and you need more time.Truly the best thing for those of us without credit cards or extra savings to help.	May 16, 2023
409	Dreadful company	I’ve been a Klarna customer for a good while, paid on time and early, great credit limit, then suddenly no your purchase has been declined please use another method. Now there’s money in my bank but I tried again with a different payment method and still declined? I speak to customer services, try again in a few hours they said, I did, same thing happens so I tell Sandeep that I want to make a complaint but apparently she can’t? Dreadful company.	May 15, 2023

414	Costumer service doesn’t exist!	I started to use Klarna in November 2022.Very happy with the services I did many purchases through Klarna, paid everything on time etc.More than three weeks ago I received an email from Klarna to prove my address.I provided document information about my address immediately.I still waiting for the answer and they just won’t let me use Klarna payment anymore!I consider myself as a very good costumer and I am really disappointed how Klarna treat me! Costumer service doesn’t exist. I asked them how long is the usual waiting time for an answer from Klarna and they reply to me that they don’t have a deadline and I have to wait!	May 16, 2023

421	Made two purchases on Amazon using…	Made two purchases on Amazon using Klarna 3 payments on the 27th April 2023, a few hours after payment, I decided to cancel one of the two items leaving me with less to pay than the original amount.Contacted Klarna, they told me to contact Amazon.Contacted Amazon and they stated payment has NOT been taken, that Klarna is a third party payment processor and that they need to fix the records on their end.Contacted Klarna again to no resolution being told to wait up until they contact me.At this point I just want to pay for the one and only item I owe cash for and to never use Klarna again.Awful company, slow to resolve issues.

423	Terrible company	Lowers your spending limit even if payments made on time. System is so slow it will process your payment but then it also says that payment is late and shows no late payment on account. Terrible Company. Is quick to take payments but won’t increase spending limit or give rewards	May 15, 2023

432	No service fees please	Klarna has truly been a godsend. However, I was charged a two dollar service fee for using the target.com website I didn’t appreciate that and would not like to have to do that again that is pay the two dollar service fee.	May 14, 2023
433	Horrible Way to get your Clientele!!!	I have paid all my purchases on time and even before due date. Now I can not make any purchases at all...	May 16, 2023
434	Lets you buy more and make payments over time	I love that I can buy stuff and make payments so I don’t have to pay one lump some and I can buy more at once so I can budget my bills. It’s a great app to use.	May 15, 2023

So Klarna please do not state you vet all youf merchants because you obviously dont!!!I wish I had used trust pilot before using klarnaI have given klarna 7 days to finish their so called investigation and to refund my money or I will take matter to my credit card company!Absolutely disgusting!	May 15, 2023

444	ZERO CUSTOMER SERVICE. DO NOT USE!!! THEY WILL TAKE YOUR MONEY	I bought several guitars from a music store and went through Klarna. 1 was defective and returned. Klarna acknowledged the return right away. However - now over 3 months later, it is STILL being billed for on my Klarna and now they’re threatening collection. I’ve gone through their chat over 25 times with ZERO resolution. They’ve upped the issue to their resolution team over 5 times now and each time they said to expect an email. The emails always  say to contact the music store. WHY?!?!  They already did their part months ago!!! It’s impossible to speak to anyone at Klarna. I’m going round in circles with ZERO RESOLUTION.  I’m considering class action lawsuit.	May 14, 2023
445	Everything about  Klarna is a shoppers…	Everything about  Klarna is a shoppers dream! Enjoy shopping for what you love and leave the worry behind by making 4 easy payments!	May 15, 2023
446	Most horrendous experience with their…	Most horrendous experience with their customer service.  I would expect that when a dispute arises this company would have the mechanisms to investigate whether or not their clients have fulfilled their obligation.   THEY HAVE NOT such mechanisms so on order to keep their money the burden of proof will be put upon you as a customer. In my case I was charged for a service that never took place and instead of asking their clients for that burden of proof they opted instead to harass me for £27 (which is nearly half of the money I voluntarily give to charity).  My contention is not even the money which I gladly paid to be able to simply and permanently terminate my account with them, but the principle!  So be warned: If it looks TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE is because it is!	May 15, 2023
447	Awesome app and super easy to use!	Awesome app and super easy to use!! Love it!! Get wgat you love and split the payments!	May 15, 2023
448	read instructions carefully!	Instructions should be followed carefully. The cards that should have been in each and every order was not in the in the package. I was very disappointed with that being that it was Mother's Day and a card should have been in there because that is what was ordered with the flowers.The most important part of all this is read the instructions carefully that the customer request to be executed!..Thanks	May 13, 2023

452	it worked well but there is no easy way to delete your account!	it worked well, but when after I was done with them, and wanted to delete my account, first theere were NO delete information option, so I had to contact support, and when I requested to delete my account, they were like"need to transfer this chat to a specialist who can help you further with this. " and so on.It is clear they try to avoid the removal of your account and I do not trust such websites.	May 15, 2023
453	You TOOK MY MONEY!!!  No Info on a reimbursement which should happen right away if this purchase is somehow not approved!!	TOOK MY MONEY!!!! But You Can't Give Me Any Information regarding my most recent payment??  I was told by one of your representatives that you're waiting for the vendor to approve the purchase. I asked how long does that take and his response from Klarna was there is no time limit which I highly doubt is true that you would hold my money that you immediately took from my bank account. and I was just told that you have no time limit as to when Klarna is going to approve this Transaction??  Based on the info that I was just given from Klarna was that Spintend has NO TIME LIMIT FOR THEM TO APPROVE THIS PAYMENT??  That makes no sense!  Your customer support needs HELP!!!!!  can barely understand their language barrier, and there is no way that if a vendor such as the one I just used NEVER approves the transaction that you have NO Time Restraints as far as when I would be receiving a REIMBURSEMENT!  Which CAN NOT BE TRUE!  You took my $$ right away and your rep has given me ABSOLUTELY NO USEFUL INFORMATION BESIDES THAT YOU ARE JUST WAITING FOR SPINTEND TO APPROVE THE PAYMENT.  I then had asked the Klarna representative: "what happens if Spintend never approves this transaction" and he then told ME there is NO TIME LIMIT for them to approve... 1 day, 3 days, 1 week, 1 month or even 1 YEAR?  he told me there is NO time limit as to when they FINALIZE THEIR APPROVAL OF THIS PURCHASE??  you have already SUCKED MY Down payment $$ From My Account and there should 100% BE SOME Time restraint as to how long they have to finalize my Order??  There Should ONLY be a few Days MAXIMUM!!  Prior to this PURCHASE TRANSACTION REGARDING WHEN I WOULD RECEIVE A REIMBURSEMENT IF THE SELLER DOESN't RESPOND AND I WAS TOLD NOOO.  AS WELL AS I was HUNG UP THE PHONE ON?? you should reimbursed my money within seven days of this company not approving this transaction!!!  you are not my bank and I know that you hold peoples money to gain interest and collect your two dollar charges!!!!   finalize the payment and get better employees who don't hang up on their customers!!!  a total embarrassment!	May 15, 2023

458	KLARNA lager SÅ inni hopetall…	KLARNA lager SÅ inni hopetall irriterende forklaringer på sin liksom kundeservice som ikke hjelper noe som helst for kunden og KLARNA skilter med god service men gir håpløst forvirrende opplysninger ! Service derimot fra diverse nettbutikk er pur ærlige i hva som skjer i retur og dato beløp er blitt refundert til bank og nå mistenker en virkelig og lurer påom en kunde blir direkte svindlet i  klarna… Nettbutikker sender jo  info om detaljert tilbake ført beløp på e-post. Noe ikke KLARNA viser og det advares faktisk fra flere hold å ikke bruke klarna… KLARNA THEN creates lots of annoying explanations for its so-called customer service which does not help the customer at allKLARNA advertises good service but gives hopelessly confusing information!Service, on the other hand, uposite  from various online stores are completely detailed honest in what happens in the return and the date the amount has been refunded to the bank and today one customer really suspects and wondersif a customer staysdirectly defrauded in the clear... Online shops do send information about detailed returned amounts by e-mail. Something that KLARNA does not show and there are actually warnings from several quarters not to use KLARNA...	May 15, 2023

461	I don’t like the recently added service…	I don’t like the recently added service fees for the non-partnered stores. I’ll be using Klarna a lot less due to this fee.	May 11, 2023
462	Fed up with klarna	Fed up with klarna. I give them proof of returns still say I owe the amounts. Went on live chat. They eventually saw the returns and told me what I owe. This has not been changed and asking for full amount. I have another dispute. Put in return whilst at the store returning faulty items. Was told in store refund takes 3 to 5 days. However it was put back to klarna , almost immediately which it shows. But my return entry still shows I owe it as it was done almost at the same time as taking back. So another fighting my hands. I will be paying my balance, then closing my account and getting rid of the app.if I don't get my refunds, I will be reporting them .	May 14, 2023

For starters, I've had Klarna for over 2 years now.The rewards are much worse and have requirements for most of them now. And most recently there is an additional charge when splitting the payments. It still allows you to split, but now it also has a $35 limit to start at. Not using this as much, because its not as worth it anymore.	May 12, 2023

492	Scammer Be careful DO NOT USE!	Be careful, Klarna do not check the stores they "partner" with. It would even seem they have their own shell companies that are fake, in order to get money out of you. They make things so complicated. To the point you just want to give up. I've caught them out, in a massive web of their own lies. Sent proof to them and reported to authorities, who have confirmed they are investigating (Action Fraud UK). Avoid at all costs!

500	I made a purchase with Expedia for a…	I made a purchase with Expedia for a holiday and opted to use klarna as a way to pay 3 monthly payments. Biggest mistake. They took out the 1st installment which is fine, I paid the 2nd installment voluntarily early. After that Klarna took 3 anonymous payments of a certain amount without my knowledge or consent. I did not authorise these payments. After querying why they took 3 random payments without my consent they blamed it on Expedia saying they said that's how they wanted the payments to happen. Well that's a load of rubbish. If I have agreed to pay 3 monthly payments through then why are Klarna changing their contract with me and following orders from Expedia? Surely I should have a say or some form of agreement for them to take my money. I contacted Klarna and spoke with someone named Ravindra who was extremely unhelpful and kept sending the same useless message again and again saying to contact Expedia and that they can't do anything. Full on robbery and they have breached their contract with me to follow the 3 monthly payment scheme. I am terrified they are going to take all my money now that they have my details as they already have done so. There is noone to contact in regards to this and what was supposed to be payments for a fun holiday has turned into a nightmare. Goodness knows if they will even leave me any money or rob me blind for all that's left in my account. Klarna should be exposed and held accountable as they have breached an agreement.	May 13, 2023

I have been waiting for over 10 days but I still get asked to “wait 5 days”. Customer service do not take any action. Interesting Klarna can keep my money for longer than they promised without any consequences. Don’t recommend using Klarna, dealing with webshops customer service is easier and quicker.	May 13, 2023

560	Save yourself the headache; Incompetent and vague customer service.	I've gone back and forth with an error on my account to the point where I decided I should close my account. Even closing your account is nonsensical. When I made an effort to close my account even that was an issue and customer service would just close out my ticket within 24 hours. They said since I didn't respond quickly enough my ticket would be closed and therefore my account would remain open but unusable for reasons they didn't want to clarify. The only thing that was an issue with my account was a late fee that was incorrectly charged to my account. When I circled back over a year later to see If I could continue using my account with the hope that things may have resolved itself, I find out that they eventually did close the account. Really silly and incompetent with no notification whatsoever.They were one of the first companies to offer financial opportunities like this but I'm glad they are not the only anymore. I recommend the many competitors they have. They won't put a hold on your account because they wrongfully charged you a late fee.  And they won't incorrectly acknowledge that my account would get updated with this fee removal. It's still marked on my account with a fee to this day. I didn't have to pay this fee because the charge I had was from Ticketmaster -- Ticketmaster canceled a concert that I almost finished paying for. Klarna refunded everything but did NOT correct the late fee after they acknowledged that I wouldn't have to make the final payment for something that was canceled and refunded already.Edit: response to reply - I don’t want a response unless it’s actionable. A real apology is fixing the behavior. No one has attempted to fix anything so you we’re better off not responding. This makes it look like you want a cookie for looking like you regret something that happened. It takes nothing to do some admin work and correct the issue. Please stop. Klarna fell short of the expectations they set, not mine.	May 15, 2022
561	Theres too much to say	Theres too much to say. Such an inconvenience to sign in to my bank every single time. Such an inconvenience to have to pay more on the first payment. Just overall a terrible app. It closes all the time and just isn’t fluid. Just to get an automated reply from Klarna telling me to call customer service. Cause that’s what a human wants. I’d like a more proactive response next time. You guys have all the info you need to contact me “proactively”.	May 11, 2023

But on the other hand i wouldnt trust it if i was running a business. But i see there's a limit on how many 5hings you can purchase at one time so thats a good thing. Some people just wont do right. Smart move tho..thats whats up!	May 12, 2023

580	Elivera fak company in KLARNA	I bought a product from a company named Elivera with a Klarna vehicle. It has been 1 month. The company is a fraudster, neither the number nor the address on the map are correct. I also live in London. There is no such thing. London Coven Garden address is given. I have reported to Klarna 3 times, although she tells me to stay on hold. What are you still waiting for. Pay my money to me urgently, please.	May 12, 2023
581	In my opinion this is a scam.	I tried to make a purchase with a company i have been dealing with for years, they now use Klarna to process there orders.Klarna rejects my credit card or any other form of payment, the only way to pay is to open a Klarna account have the goods on a 30 day differed payment and then pay using the same card they then except. In my opinion Klarna is rejecting payments on purpose to get you to sign up with them, and hopefully make lots of money from late payments.Or the company i am dealing with is getting a kick back.Either way i think this is a scam.

I started using Klarna & spends lots of money with them, just yesterday my payments were declining, money on the account but when called the HELPDESK they were very unhelpful. Will pay my arrears & never use them again. Advise the same to everyone else.	May 10, 2023
601	Whenever I have a return and the price…	whenever i have a return and the price is updated with the merchant. it alsmost never updates with Klarna. i have to report it and my accoubt gets marked as late. However, once you repprt a return it does not allow a payment to be made without cancelling the return reported. This results in reduced availble credit because it appears the payment is late. When reaching out to Klarna customer service they do not always read the concern and provide misinformation or a delayed response that is automated. The compamy now charges to use the service and this update was not conveyed until a purchase was attempted.	March 29, 2023

608	I have been using Klarna for years and…	I have been using Klarna for years and was very happy with it except now, for some reason, I’m getting service fees added to my payments. In addition to that I can now only purchase an Amazon gift card to purchase items from Amazon. I have continually paid off all payments early and have not missed a single payment. After I messaged a customer service agent they could not explain the service fee and claimed it’s generated at random - which I find hard to believe since legally there has to be an explanation for any fee added. Very disappointed so i’ve paid off all of my accounts with Klarna and will be closing my account and switching to Afterpay instead.	April 22, 2023
609	Happy with this app and service	Have been using Klarna for 1,5 yrs now and I always found them helpful, customer focused and friendly. There were times when my payment was delayed due to financial difficulties and I have always been offered an option to settle things comfortably. Overall happy with their service, it's a great platform offering easy, straightforward split or borrow payment, easy to use and agents are helpful. I'd recommend and hopefully others will have similar experiences	May 11, 2023

Terrible company to do business with.Once you start scaling your business they will hold your money for more than 3 weeks and don't give you any signs why and when to receive your money.There are no disputes at all and still... wondering if we ever get it or consider it as lost...

616	Don't plan on returns being easy	I purchased 4 items (2 rotors, brakes, and windshield wipers totalling about $130) at the end of March.  I paid klarna in full the next month.  About 5 days ago I ended up returning 3 of the items (rotors and brakes totalling about $110).  Klarna returned only $22 of my money and said its "resolved". I've been trying to tell them they still owe me the rest of my money ($88) and sent proof of return and the place I ordered from also registered the return, but still nothing. Klarna is great until you have to return something. I guess I have to get my bank involved.Update: they responded to my original 1star review and provided a phone number. I called and they fixed my issue the next day. Ty	May 11, 2023

Body and fit made a massive error and returned my parcel immediately to sender for reasons that are unclear, exactly this time I did choose for paying with Klarna.Klarna expects me to pay for something I didn't receive and will never receive, they basicly tell me to figure it out with body and fit. Unhelpful and arrogant customer service.Never ever again.	May 11, 2023

626	I was enjoying using klarna but…	I was enjoying using klarna but recently had a full refund from a site. I paid the initial payment from my bank account then paid the second payment but klarna only refunded one payment and telling me I only made one payment which is false,so they are keeping the payment I had made. Live chat was of absolutely no help at all. So I've basically lost £65 which is dissapointing.	May 11, 2023
627	4000€ transaction disappeared and no one help me to track it!	I opened a Klarna bank account and the first time I used it for a salary payroll account. Since it’s a German bank account with German IBAN, so this should be totally smooth, right?Not only I didn’t receive my payment on time and this money is STILL NOT IN MY ACCOUNT and it has been successfully transferred almost 2 WEEKS ago!!! I, of course, contacted the customer service, and everyone was telling me either to “wait” or “Please contact another department”There were 2-3 customer supports told me they will report this issue to their supervisor and will contact me in 1-2 days. But at least 4 days have past, I still don’t have any support, investigation, don’t even think about an answer. The transaction was made on 28.04.2023. Until today (11.05.2023), the payment is still not in my account and I don’t have any feedback or follow up from them. I hope someone from their supervisor level contacts me directly to solve this issue after they see this review(seems like they reply faster to  bad reviews than really working on their product)I will close the bank account anyway after this problem is solved and god knows how long would it take.	May 11, 2023
628	Some stores make it tricky to use Klarna	Easy to navigate the Klarna app but when shopping at some stores, it’s sometimes difficult to select Klarna as payment.

650	I use it all the time	I use it all the time , even when I don’t need to , just to grow my purchase credit. I love the flexibility of payments. I’m happy to see more and more online stores accept it now, although even on sites that don’t automatically take klanra it’s so easy to get a one time use credit card. The only app that doesn’t ask for social security number or runs your credit on purchases under $200.	April 28, 2023

654	Great!	Making purchasing costlier products feel a little more affordable by splitting the cost over 3 months without adding interest.	May 10, 2023
655	Sudden Service Fee added	Been using Klarna for awhile now. It truly helps but suddenly when using the non partnered stores there’s a $2 “service fee” added. No heads up on it or anything. Some will say it’s only $2 but as much as we use Klarna that $2 adds up fast. A heads up would of been nice. Will probably watch where I use it from now on if I keep using it.	May 09, 2023

658	No Buyer Protection If Company Buying From Does You Over	As the title suggests, Klarna did nothing to investigate or help me with a dispute with the vendor (in this case Look Fantastic.com) I was sent a product that was not as described and essentially a scam (Avant Skincare), I had no power to withhold or my money so that I could return the product for a refund or get my concern addressed).Someone from CS emailed me to tell e not to contact them about this issue uness I have further information on the case, they never asked me for more information. Rather cheeky given that I’ve a legitimate concern, and that they are customer services. The bottom line is only use Klarna if you know the vendor and product, even then be wary as if something does happen to go wrong they do not help and take money from your bank regardless.

665	Keep in mind	Haven’t had any issues with Klarna, only thing to keep in mind is that split payments isn’t always available, same with moving the payment date forward. So don’t go relying on being able to do that <33	May 10, 2023

Have made at least 20 orders since then and paid on time or early yet the pointless limit of £200 remains the same no matter what I do to try to get it increased.Now an urgent order for a new paper shredder after mine just blew up has been refused because my available to spend is short by £10.I did love the facilities offered with the klarna card and pay in 3 but enough is enough, time to go back to credit card and just pay a little interest or just pay in full by debit card.Sorry Klarna your AI sucks, I have not missed any payment to anyone in over 2 years yet your AI says I'm a bad risk.Back to the credit card it is and just pay off each month.

I ALWAYS pay and have never missed a payment in the 12 years of being able to have credit! I am now receiving debt letters from an agency! I am having to take time out of my working day to send all my receipts which I luckily save in an email box! You have caused me distress as I'm saving for a mortgage and this can affect my credit rating therefore affecting my future. Not only that asked for a call back from customer service as a matter of urgency with regards to the matter after someone raising it with another team and I was told no, email only and 3-5 working days. Shame on you as a business! I will be contacting you yet again tomorrow for a 3rd time in a row!	January 24, 2023

704	Klarna won’t help	Klarna have partnered probably unknowingly to a scam company called “the look edit” I ordered three dresses which were never received. I contacted the clothing store they acknowledged I hadn’t received them and would refund me (Klarna). This didn’t happen, I opened an investigation with Klarna and provided proof that “the look edit” had acknowledged I didn’t receive my order and would receive a refund.Klarna “communicated” with the look edit and sent me a generic email saying they had provided proof via Royal Mail my package was received so I needed to pay. If you follow the tracking link the image taken of the parcel is clearly labelled with a different name and address to mine and that’s all Klarna needs as proof apparently. Your name and address don’t need to be yours it just needs to be a photo of a random parcel delivered by Royal Mail with a different tracking code to the one I was provided? I even provided Klarna with the evidence of my address on my order to prove that couldn’t be my order and they sent another generic response.I refuse to pay.	May 09, 2023

Seeking legal advice now.	May 02, 2023

730	Fast and efficient!!		May 08, 2023
731	Klarna is so convenient!	I absolutely love Klarna! Ever since I have discovered them my shopping experiences have been amazing and more convenient when it’s time to pay. I think the only thing is they don’t always accept all cards for purchasing. Usually, I have to get money transferred to a different acct or card they accept just so I can buy the products. After that I’m able to use any card to make payments, but it would be great if I could use my regular visa debit card for the purchase upfront. Other than that highly recommend using them!	March 01, 2023
732	What’s happened to Klarna . . .	What’s happened to Klarna. I’ve gone from £2700 purchase power to £100 without any obvious reason why. This severe fluctuating between limits makes it an unusable payment method.	May 08, 2023
733	Klarna really let me down	Klarna really let me down. I had a Klarna card always made payments in time. I had fraud on my credit card; notified them and closed the card. Two months later when they finally got to my issue they closed my card, and account down. They told me I could get Amy account reactivated; reached out to customer service and I’ve been trying to get my account fixed for months, only to be told due to fraud my account was closed. How? It wasn’t my fault? The merchant refunded the money, and the card had been cancelled. So I’m at fault because someone used my card info online?  No one can tell you what to do ? How has someone who was responsible for paying every payment on time at fault. I will never recommend them to anyone ..	May 08, 2023
734	Ok until there’s a problem….	Have used Klarna for a couple of years now. Always paying outstanding bills promptly and currently have a zero balance. Up until recently all good. A  problem recently occurred when my current debit card had a month before expiry. All my transactions using Klarna being declined. I therefore ordered a new debit card and added it as my primary payment method deleting the old on. Still not working. Tried to resolve the issue using the online chat system also on the phone with customer services. Neither had any idea what the problem was and how to resolve it, suggesting reasons which didn’t apply in my case. I had no option but to go back on to the chat system asking them to delete the account in the hope I might be able to create a new one.  Am still waiting for this to happen as my all my details are still showing in the app. It seems when something goes wrong with Klarna no one is able to help!	May 04, 2023
735	Great experience	Because you have the ability to purchase items and make a payment plan when you don’t have the full amount to purchase items and you get regular buying power to increase your credit line.	April 26, 2023

757	Best shopping app and bank app!		May 08, 2023
758	I wish they would bring the old Klarna back	I’ve been using Klarna for many years now, and the more changes they’ve made the more I am less likely to use the platform. They’ve changed it from regular cards to gift cards. It takes even longer to get any sort of reward and if you even get the reward, it’s not on any of the places that I personally shop so the rewards are essentially useless, and on top of that now they’re charging extra fees just to be able to use it. I find that very unfortunate.	May 07, 2023
759	Excellent experience!!	Excellent experience! I love to use Klarna every time that I need to buy gifts for someone else or to buy nice things for myself in payments. Really easy to use and wide variety of products!	May 07, 2023

770	Klarna is the best way to Buy Now, Pay Later	Klarna is the most , not one of the most but the most trustworthy and the most respected way to pay.  I appreciate Klarna for offering this option to pay because it really does help not just myself but I’m sure millions of people who might not be able to pay a huge total up front, but with Klarna they make it possible for many people to be able to get many different things and just pay a small down payment and give you time to pay. I absolutely love Klarna!!  Thank you so very much Klarna for making it easy to buy now, pay later.  I totally respect that of you.	May 07, 2023
771	Kind Klarna!	Klarna has made it possible for me to have a credit line when no other companies will do that for me. There’s a lot of deals and I appreciate this company.	May 07, 2023

777	Not as good as they were.	Not very good anymore in variious areas.	May 07, 2023
778	Too unpredictable	Too unpredictable. I’ve got a Klarna card but the chopping and changing of available ‘purchase power’ from £,1000 to nothing is just silly and very frustrating. I’ve had a message for 2 months now saying ‘something went wrong and we can’t calculate your purchase power - come back later’. I’ve been in touch with customer service through the online chat and they just give generic answers with no actual information. Klarna need to be more transparent about the decisions they make.

I’ve charged many hotel rooms and no interest is collected. I’ve built my limit to $1,000. Oh if you don’t have the money when a payment is due, you can extend it at no cost.

835	I have spent roughly $4,000 on this app…	I have spent roughly $4,000 on this app since about December of last year. Suddenly, I am no longer able to place any orders - and the app cites, "Your identity could not be verified as required for this credit product. This won’t affect your credit score.Please check that your details are correct before trying again.After carefully reviewing your request, you weren't approved for this credit product because the identity on your application couldn't be verified."I then check what info is listed under my contact info in my Klarna account, which is my correct (and current) information. I examine the denial further and see they attempted to verify my identity with TransUnion - I go and pay out of pocket for my TransUnion report to compare, and the information is VERBATIM THE EXACT SAME. Less than two weeks I was able to place an order for over $1,500 via the app. Between then and now, NONE of my information has changed, and TransUnion kindly informed me that no information on my credit report had changed since that date either.Frustrated, I put in a request to delete all of my data and close my account, thinking I might just try starting over fresh with a new account. Then I realized I would be forfeiting all of my accrued rewards, and likely reset my spending power back to what a new user's would be, and chatted support in hopes of cancelling. Not only did two separate reps completely not understand that I wanted to cancel an existing request before it was processed (they instead said "sorry to see you go, what was the reason you wish to cancel your account?" despite being very clear in my message), I eventually learned nothing could be done.So now I have no recourse to preventing an account deletion - great! Sort of my own doing, but oh well.Then the thought occurs to me - what if I just try making a new Klarna account and try using the same info? Well, turns out that can be done! It'll prompt that your phone number's already associated with an existing account, and ask if you'd like to unlink it with the existing account and to associate with the new one. Did that, goes through just fine, enter in all of my information (the exact same info that the other account declined upon attempting purchases), and GUESS WHAT! Identity confirmed! $2,340 spending power, not a starting amount! They found my info and I fixed the problem, thank goodness!I then excitedly go to place my order I've now been trying to place for over 3 hours. Enter in my card info, select pay in 4, agree to the terms, hit the submit button.... and YET AGAIN, DENIED BECAUSE MY IDENTITY CANNOT BE CONFIRMED WITH TRANSUNION.I never write reviews for sites or services - seriously, I've maybe only done it once in my 27 years on this planet, despite tons of places deserving a scathing review. That's because, unlike Klarna, those places and services don't gaslight you into thinking everything is okay again, before flat out denying you one more time.If you want your life to be like that of Sisyphus, I highly recommend signing up. If you want to spend money with the app as intended and get reasonable, advertised use out of the service (which, outside of this issue, was great until now!) then STAY FAR AWAY.I am only writing this review here because it seems they actually monitor Trustpilot reviews - BBB and other methods, including directly contacting them, are often ignored. In fact, there are at least 3 posts on Reddit referencing this EXACT issue that are over a year old, with dozens of other users who experienced the same thing!It boggles my mind a finance company is able to keep its doors open when it cannot verify ABSOLUTELY correct data, that was meticulously ENTERED VERBATIM AS IT APPEARS ON THEIR STATED SOURCE DOCUMENT (TRANSUNION CREDIT REPORT).This has left an extremely sour taste in my mouth and support reps are unable to assist in any way, they just tell me I'll receive a notice within 25 days that'll say the exact same thing and then assure that nothing else can be done to rectify the problem. SO HELPFUL!I took my business to Afterpay who had ZERO ISSUE approving my purchase using the exact same report, it literally says TransUnion for them too! Klarna need to get their engineering or fraud team on this issue, it appears to have been an issue for far too long. Even if they were able to help me, I still have extreme reservations that this will simply happen again the next time I try to place an order. I'm sorry to say it, but I think they've lost my business for good.	May 05, 2023

847	Trustworthy service	It’s really trustworthy and it helps a lot.Currently they only charge $2 on the first week purchase which is way better compare to other apps. I prefer this app compare to other apps due to their variety of stores partnerships and etc. I only have one problem and that’s being waitlisted for their physical card for maybe a year now? I don’t really know. They could still be working on it which is fine. I don’t really need it yet.	May 05, 2023
848	I honestly wish I could rate you zero…	I honestly wish I could rate you zero stars.At Christmas time I used the pay in three option to split up the cost of some presents, the last payment was in February and that all went though okay. 10 days later you sent me emails saying my bank has rejected the payments, I contacted your customer service straight away with screen shots of my bank proving that the payments hadn't failed and your customer service advisor told me I'd have to pay again. I reached out to some of the companies I'd used your service for to confirm they had received their payments and all of them confirmed and said they'd received the money with no issues. I sent you an email 6 weeks ago with every piece of evidence that I'd paid and there wasn't any issues on my end and you ignored me, I chased up a further 3 times to be ignored again!!!! You now have a debt collector on my back because you didn't answer my emails and I'm absolutely disgusted and heart broken to now be in this position. I have reported you wherever I can and I hope other people read this and are warned to stay away because this has ruined me and I've had to take out a loan to make the repayments, I'm absolutely fuming.

929	Klarna is easy to use, but	Klarna is easy to use, I’ve had a good purchase power I was able to increase. However, if you missed payment by due will bunch together with next payment, and if you want to make the payment you missed before the new payment is do it will not let you. You will have to make the payment for both even though the next payment is not due yet.	February 03, 2023

934	They will steal your money	I have been going back and forth since about scamming store LIFTFaD. They would not refund my money even though I sent over 50 emails from liftfad proving I had defective items and had not received others. They took 800 from me!!!! Both klarna and liftfad are scammers. This payment service should be shut down as they allow scamming stores to get away with illegal practices. Your bank account is not safe with them. STAY AWAY.Reply: I have contacted you all for over 6 months about this and customer service ignored all my evidence. Like I said you need to be shut down for supporting scammers. That store has some of the worst ratings on the internet!	September 02, 2022

937	Is veryyy Top		May 03, 2023
938	Perfect for Flex Budget!!!	Folks got so much to say when it comes down to this particular app. But I gotta say that this app has been one of the greatest apps I’ve ever used. If you are a person who struggle with managing your money appropriately then I would say this is probably not the app for you but if you are a person who know how to use your money in smart ways especially when you are trying to improvise in between rough financial spots this would be the perfect app to help you through those moments. This app has been one of the greatest for me and honestly I don’t know how I would even continue to go on without this app. Me and my family truly love this app more than words can say. Thank you Klarna we ❤️ you so much… I will do a video on YouTube about this very soon.	May 03, 2023

942	Simple and easy to use	Simple and easy to use.  Klarna has allowed me to purchase items for my home and for me, when I seen them and not when I have saved the money for them.   It’s like saving for something but in reverse.  When an unexpected bill has came in I have been able to move my payments dates to my next pay date.	May 03, 2023

947	Given a second chance.	The fact that this company is giving a chance to customers to prove themselves to purchase without fault. Giving another chance to and individual with low credit. The only thing that I wish is that there was a process to really understand not getting the Klarna card yet, even when the person is doing well.	June 15, 2022

However, I don’t like the fact the purchase power fluctuates, even after making a $600 payment smh.

They tell me its ASOS they say klarna has left the ASOS platform or another advisor said technical issue been about 6 weeks now not resolved not sure who to believe either way customer service unhelpful as issue not resolved.Shame as felt it generally worked well but not sure what is going on hard to get an answer.

1017	Shady!!	I purchased a Peloton bike in 2021 and used Klarna’s interest free credit plan for 39 months and it was agreed there would be £49 instalments during this period. Up until now I have had no issues. Last month it said I had £657 remaining after my payment cleared.  I checked my account this month and decided I would like to make the payment slightly earlier and I noticed it now says I have £697 remaining and it says I would now have a £99 final payment, the balance is incorrect and the terms were changed against my agreement!I spoke to customer service and they said they can’t update it and I have to wait until the payment clears and no explanation  was provided why this happened and no apology. Absolutely appalling and shady that the balance was suddenly incorrect and my final payment was £50 more.I will check again once the payment clears to see if it has updated and will update my review!

So basically I lost 500 points and it was never replenished.  So I decided not to submit my order to Overstock for this reason.	April 23, 2023

1075	Do not use for sneaker drops until fixed.	though the app tells you that Nike is a partner, making a purchase of a sneaker drop is damn near impossible. There is no Klarna option on the SNKRS site and attempts to create a card tell you they are already a partner so the app won't give you the option. anyone that knows sneakers knows purchases are very time sensitive. the amount of wasted time spent trying to complete a purchase will lose you a pair of shoes. i had to hurry up, back out, and pay in full directly on their app. Very frustrating.	April 29, 2023

1078	makes no since! …	I don’t understand when you make your payments and you have funds available and when you go to purchase something it denies your purchase. Why does it do that when you have funds to purchase and your up to date on payments. Why decline a purchase to go through. I don’t get it! That’s why I don’t use Klarna all the time and I prefer some of the other ones like Afterpay and Sezzle cause they never deny if your up to date on payments and have funds to purchase. There should be no reason for being denied. That’s my biggiest issue with Klarna!	April 29, 2023
1079	I absolutely LOVE Klarna	I absolutely LOVE Klarna.  It has offered me opportunities for a higher purchase power than I’d had before as well as the ability to save my cash for more important things.  So I can purchase the frivolous things with Klarna and not feel the guilt! 🧡I LOVE it!	April 29, 2023
1080	I have good credit score 900+ and don't…	I have good credit score 900+ and don't have any debt what so ever yet they refused to allow me to buy a bike on finance. Why should i get punished cos i haven't had a credit card for 10+ years and be debt free?. Its not fair in fact I'm disgusted. I work full time and have no rent and all the payment was was £72. i spend £68 a month on bus tickets so can clearly afford it. Why should only people who use credit card allowed credit	April 29, 2023
1081	Love it!!!!!	Have the oppotiunity to purchrse the items I want and not investing all thr money all at one. I can use thr rest of the money for something else.	April 28, 2023
1082	Stay Away	Ok so I am going to detail the issues with Klarna. 1.credit application and decision is very unclear to the point of Klarna becoming a gambling site. Even if you are an excellent payer you can be refused, And sure its disappointing but it would be so helpful if they told you the reason (See problem 2).2. Once refused an application it can take roughly 10 mins before you discover the reason why however the reason is so vague that its hard to understand what they mean. For example lets say you have 10 orders currently totalling lets say £100 and you apply for a further item maybe not on the same day as the others but you make an application and they decline it will say "You have exceeded your allowed limit" and ok fair enough so is my current amount too much or the amount of orders too much or is it the amount i am currently asking for?. 3. Whats super irritating is everytime you apply they credit search you (Soft search) But still a seach now I used to work for a company who delt with credit reference agencies and every though a soft search can not reduce your rating it is still visible to other lenders so every time you apply to Klarna and get refused other lenders can see this and although I have never missed a a payment and always paid before any due date they still treat me in such a cloak and dagger way.4. When you ring customer service you then find out that you have exceeded your limit is a common error and they do not know what limit is means or why. Why are they there if they cannot provide answers.in closing i used to consider Klarna one of the best but until recently I feel let know and messed around to the point of this affecting mental health. I am sorry Klarna but you are the worst pay in 3 i have ever had until you can be honest I don't feel you should receive any money	April 29, 2023

A week later I got an email stating stock had come in and they would send tracking number. I finally got tracking number which was fake and asked company correct tracking they ignore emails and now bounce back. After checking reviews I now realise they scammed a lot of people as I was one of first to purchase I’m now waiting on klarna to investigate which is taking forever and they have paused money but I paid in full . Update finally got refunded by Klarna excellent	April 28, 2023

1169	NEVER USE KLARNA.	Klarna need to change the way they refund their customers. It’s bad enough that they strip you of all the usual consumer protections that you would get with most other forms of credit. Their customer service agents on the chat facility are worse than useless, the standard responses you get from them and even the people that respond to trust pilot reviews are passive aggressive, snarky, blame the customer for the failures of Klarna as a business and try to explain away their shortcomings by trying to educate you on their process, processes that are utterly rubbish by the way. I look forward to getting another useless reply from Klarna telling me how they are sorry I feel poorly about having my money held hostage for around two weeks while I was dealing with a retailer  that had already told me that they had processed my refund. Klarna deserves to fail. You may have a couple of good experiences with them, but they will eventually let you down and let you down badly. They let you down even when things run smoothly by removing your consumer rights by acting as a credit provider whilst pretending that they aren’t really and therefore don’t have to abide by consumer protection laws.	April 27, 2023
1170	Very easy to use	Very easy to use. Love the new way to shop on Amazon (gift cards issued). No issues yet and I’ve been using Klarna for months now. Split payments made Christmas time shopping much easier also.	April 27, 2023

1172	Klarna is the best!	Klarna is my absolute favorite way to pay when I do online shopping, even if I don’t need to break up the payments. Only paying for 25% of the cost of an item while deciding whether to keep or return is fantastic! I’m also really impressed with the system Klarna has in place for letting me know ahead of time when a payment is coming up, as there are multiple notifications leading up to the day a payment is due. Not just that, but they don’t try to debit the amount at midnight on the due date; it seems they don’t actually even try until the very end of the business day (if not the next?). Really nice way to help customers maintain their payments without incurring fees. No overdrafts, easy budgeting and heaven forbid I find myself in a bind one day and need to skip a payment because that’s an option, too (and with no penalty). Returns are easy. When I need to make a return, I select the item and let them know. As soon as the return is received the money automatically is refunding without needing to follow up. Needless to say I’m not typically inclined to write long and detailed reviews for a financing company, but I have been so pleasantly surprised with the ease of use for this app that it’s rare I will use a different one (that means you, Sezzle. First overdraft I had in ages 🤨). Only caveat worth mentioning is that Klarna won’t let me use it for certain companies and websites, which is a huge bummer. I wasn’t able to use it when taking advantage of some recent sales and I would have liked to. I hope that changes, but everything else is perfect.	April 25, 2023

Customer support is professional and responds quickly to inquiries. Klarna is transparent in pricing and there are no hidden fees. I can definitely recommend Klarna.	April 27, 2023
1185	Klarna's system error messages…	Klarna's system error messages confirmed two attempts at booking an item to have not been successful. So I then booked direct with the company.Then, when I go into Klarna, the two erroneous "orders" were there. This is from September 2022. I registered the issue with them. Despite the fact it is their issue - their faulty system, I am being asked to liaise with the shop to get them to confirm  that they do not need the payment. The shop has said they have contacted Klarna.I have managed to get one erroneous cancelled off but the other still remains and they will not cancel it off. In the meantime they ask for information and not once have taken responsibility for their faulty system which caused this error in the first place. Why should I deal with their customer, which Klarna messed up the booking for? They should liaise with them. Despite this I still have done this and provided the details to klarna, This is still ongoing and I am now going to complain to the financial ombudsman if they do not cancel this if and refund me. All they need to do is look at the IT booking records and they will be able to see that there were error messages. All I need is the payment refunded and the other entry cancelled. I have never missed any payments with Klarna and  this pushing for payment for something I have not had, and ignoring the fact they are responsible for the error - is extremely unfair. I have lodged a complaint but I do not have much hope. There is no email and the app is frustratingly slow and glitches. We shall see what happens - my most recent contact who took  my complaint seems more competent and caring than the others.	September 20, 2022

1202	Klarnas slogan of "pay when and how you want" is a straight up lie	I have used Klarna for a long time, but I'm inclined to rate them a one star after my most recent experience with them. This has unfortunately shown me that Klarna is now mostly out to screw people out of their money instead of being helpful and solution oriented.I made an original purchase with a 12 month part-payment plan. This was a no interest plan that allowed me to have a low amount to pay each month. 6 months in I converted another big purchase into a 3 month part-payment plan which I intended to pay off faster (this has different interest rate than my first 12 month plan). Fast forward to this month when it's time to pay, and I pay an amount that would cover the amount according to the first purchase (12 month plan) + the WHOLE sum of the second purchase (3 month plan). The app now decides to close my favourable, low interest plan of 12 months and half-pay my new 3 month plan.So I'm now in a situation where I have payed double my plan and stuck with a higher monthly cost for the next months + more money in interests because the amount that is left is higher than the original 12 month plan. This doesn't sound like a big problem because previously I had been able to call Klarna directly and have them manually close one of my purchases and keep the other one going. THIS IS NOT THE CASE ANYMORE!!!Chatting to Klarna's customer service reveals that it is not possible to pick which plan to close first (this is illegal by Swedish law because we are allowed to pay off ANY loan whenever we want, this is to allow us to not have to pay extra interest unnecessarily), I ask them why I was able to do it before and I get the answer that it is not possible to do it for part-payment plans.Then they tell me that the purchase with the closest end-date would be the one that would automatically be paid off in full (which is my 3 month plan because I still have 4 months left of my 12 month plan) but this is simply not correct. Klarna will automatically keep the plan which is more favourable for them, resulting in me having to pay higher interest rates and have higher monthly costs EVEN THOUGH I have transferred enough money to cover the 3 month plan in FULL and pay according to my 12 month plans deal.Their CS agents straight up lies. One person also told me a full refund is NOT possible, but I had already gotten a refund process started and CONFIRMED by the first agent I talked to. I'm happy I asked the second agent if I could get a full refund, because now I have it black and white that their agents lie. They speak only out of their own understanding of what's possible and what's not. Your help will be dictated by who you talk to and how helpful they want to be + how knowledgable they are of work-arounds.I will pursue things further legally. Big corporations should not be allowed to get away with things like this. Any other bank would happily close one of my plans with the money that I HAVE PAID.This is a super disheartening situation to be in because I have been a happy Klarna customer for over 10 years, but I will simply never use their services again because:- Their customer service is not solution oriented.- They can not refund you the money you have paid and undo the purchase so I can decide FOR MYSELF how to handle my money and my loans.- They remove functionality that make it possible to manually distribute the money paid into your part-payment account.- You are not allowed to talk to any of the customer service agents managers or chiefs on the phone.- You are forced to interact with their managers by email which will take several days or even weeks to finalise the process.- One agent told me they will refund the full amount that I paid, meanwhile another says they can not refund the full amount and that I will only be refunded the extra amount that is required to pay according to my terms.Horrible customer service, horrible logic being applied to money management by their app, horrible education of their customer service staff. Just a horrible experience with Klarna in general. Enough to make me never want to use their service ever again.	April 27, 2023

1221	love klarna but...	love klarna, always use to split the cost to buy different things, they are good and they provide a good service, even costumer service always there if you face an issue.the only thing i find it not fair is if your score credit went down the klarna power purchase go down too, i use klarna most of time and my power purchase fall to £150 comparative with £1000 last year and never delayed to pay back, most of cases i paid early. my suggestions is it may be a good idea if klarna reward customers who used klarna in weekly basis to not lower their klarna purchase power as long as they paying always on time.  for this reason i give 4 stars.thank you	April 27, 2023

1242	Absolutely waste of time.	Absolutely waste of time.You dispute a transaction and Klarna agents take months to reply-Then they just don’t do anything.Just use your card as you bank/lender will help.Klarna is okay until you face an issue.I disputed a transaction as I didn’t receive what I ordered- klarna did nothing but mark as resolved.Closing my account- Use paypal or other payment methodsAdditional information on awful reply from klarna.I did everything they quoted- Klarna has a team who investigate- It took 4 months and absolutely nothing was done.A credit card is only a payment method- but if you have a dispute- they actually do investigate properly.So beware if you pay by klarna and get an issue- klarna won’t help you and you will waste your time trying to sort this out.Honestly just use a better payment option	December 26, 2022
1243	Fraudulent activity	Someone fraudulent bought something in my name. Wrong email, phone number, no ID. How is klarna allowing people to so easily buy things with just a name and address.

1251	You either love or hate it	I love klarna for 3 part payments however, one time cards never seem to work for me and buy now pay later seems to work when it wants to, depending on the store. overall, I dislike it, besides the 3 part payment it’s basically useless to me.Another issue is the fact that I had a open dispute against a company who refused to refund my money and because I used klarna for payment I had to go through them and despite all the proof I provided klarna did not get round to having my item refunded.

1276	No Refund despite showing evidence…	Despite providing proof several times of a refund from Shein, Klarna refuse to refund my money. Completely put me off using them again and will be taking the matter to the Ombudsman. Operators are useless and do not look into disputes. Would not recommend this company!28.04.23 Update to your reply. This did go to the disputes team who were useless and just closed the matter without using any of the evidence I provided. I sent a further email with several documents confirming I am due the refund and two days on, I’ve received nothing. I will wait the 6 weeks and simply get the ombudsman and involved as this is far too stressful! If you want to avoid this, then give me back the money you have held unlawfully.	April 06, 2023

1318	My likes and dislikes about Klarna	How Im allowed to use my purchase power for with different stores or online to make seperate purchases. Also how its so easy to make a adjustment on your payment amount and it changes it instantly to allow you to see what you owe now and to make an accurate payment. But what I dont like is that you have to make your first payment tge day of your purchase. I think the first payment should be set up for automatic withdrawal within 2 weeks of the authorized purchase or the following month depending on if you choose bi-weekly or monthly. But overall I love Klarna. - Aliyah (Lawrenceville, GA)	April 25, 2023

I thought I placed the order but  although £36.75 was withdrawn from my bank account, the order wasn't placed. I called Klarna Customer Service.  A lady said money is on hold and will be refunded in 1-7 business days.If the order can't be placed, you mustn't withdraw money from your customer account and I said the first instalment was withdrawn. What kind of a hold is that? You are apparently using the money.And please don't give me a generic response. I already chatted and called 0800 189 33 33.	April 25, 2023

1330	Another payment was declined	Another payment was declined, it was merely 60£. The last time I was unable to pay with Klarna was the 11th of April 2023 and I was told by the customer service advisor that I should try after 24 hours. I tried now and even cleared two purchases between this. Not sure what kind of Algorithm Klarna is using. I have an excellent credit history with no missed payments at all. At least they should give a budget to individuals so that they know the limit they have. I know there will be a standard composed reply from them after this review similar to last time........Klarna is a Joke	April 25, 2023

1374	Extremely disappointing service from Klarna	Dear Patrick,Pleas stop providing a standard reply’sAll the information needed to resolve this issue is below.please read it and fix it. If you are are not authorized to do this, please forward this information to the appropriate person within klarna. thank you! - - - -Dear Klarna,I am horrified to read that in the matter of order TIM3172339 you have ruled in favor of the customer.We have provided a huge amount of evidence that clearly shows that the customer is lying.Please provide a clear explanation as to why you have ruled in favor of the customer. Does a company have no rights with Klarna?So every customer can say they did not receive something or received something wrong, regardless of whether they received it but tel lies so they don't have to pay.We are extremely disappointed with Klarna and urge you to review this decision and review all supporting documents.Dispute ID: 196611247 - Your store K641147 has a dispute request that has been resolved.Hello!We are contacting you to inform you that your dispute request has been resolved.Dispute detailsDispute Reason goods_not_receivedDispute ID 196611247Merchant Reference 1 TIM3172339	April 24, 2023

1379	Excellent service.		April 24, 2023
1380	Regular customer declined	Have always loved Klarna, I always pay back on time if not early have never had any issues using before. Went on yesterday to be declined a purchase and to use another means of payment because of credit scoring! I didn’t think Klarna used credit scoring to decide and didn’t think they based their decisions on what a persons credit score was.	April 23, 2023
1381	Pratiksha needs recognition!	Communication is really key and klarna know this very well. Anytime I've had an issue or even just question they are super helpful and efficient.

1431	1 in 5 chance of bad experience	One in five chances you’ll get scammed by Klarna. Look at their one star reviews. You’ve basically got a 1 in 5 chance of having a terrible experience with them. Avoid.	April 22, 2023
1432	Pray you don’t need a refund.	Pray you don’t need a refund.They will keep you waiting long after you’ve returned the item and make excuses about their gif awful processes. And when you leave a ooor review they will passive aggressively suggest it’s your fault for not checking your email or providing the information. Even when you’ve done both.	April 22, 2023

1442	Won't be bothering with them again.	I just went to pay for an order on Etsy and decided as it was over £50 and also because before now I never had a moments problem in three years of using them. I went through all the hoops, verification codes galore on my phone as well as my laptop I was using to browse Etsy. Then, for absolutely no reason I can fathom - as everything about me and my information is the same as it has been for 3 years, payments and bank numbers - the order was declined. Now if I am going to be declined then I want to know why and for them to have the GOOD MANNERS to interact with me to tell me why so I can do something about it. So I tried. Chat to us, it said...really HOW? Everything I have entered has gone straight back to the fact that the order was declined and they make it quite plain that they will not give out any information as to why. So you know what Klarna, you can go and decline someone else as I for one will not bother with you again, PayPal has the same x 3 payment scheme and I used that. They have the intelligence to actually interact with their customers and that is worth far more than any offer you can make.	April 22, 2023

Their customer service and business practices are totally lacking and shocking.	April 21, 2023

1503	Not a good deal! Bad business practice!	This company paired with Scanpay and gutted me for 219.00 for a service I never received after they wanted to the service was canceled. Of course after waiting on the side of the road for over 8 hours for roadside assistance with my 2 daughters in Tennessee. And Klarna sided with them to not realizing why not cancel when you haven't received service.	April 08, 2023
1504	I love it	I love it. Need a higher limit though	April 21, 2023
1505	Abysmal customer service; discriminatory against financial institutions	Klarna discriminate against certain financial institutions, and their customer support is terrible.They allow adding a Wise card, but do not allow it to be used for purchases. On this occasion, and previous occasions for other issues, their customer support has been useless. They do not care about resolving issues, not a single bit.Their customer service cited "a history of payment issues" causing them to deny Wise customers use of their service. Customer service also said this will never be fixed by Klarna.I have also had similar issues in the past using N26, but they seem to have resolved it.These shady practices alongside their lack of customer support are reasons to avoid using Klarna.

1509	Purchased a Karcher on the 22 March	Purchased a Karcher on the 22 March, paying Klarna directly,when no purchase was forthcoming I tried the company that was supplying it Brandsoutlet .uk there was no reply to emails,there number was unobtainable, I rang Klarna they said they would start a complaint case, on hearing nothing or response to emails to Klarna I tried online chat, the first time the wait time was 185 minutes, the second time it was 58 minutes before I could get an agent,the person was very nice and assured me he would contact the complaints team and mark urgent on it, I wish to get a refund and as my bank statement states Klarna where paid I feel they should refund me. This has been running 30 days.	March 22, 2023

I've moved address and updated my details through the app. I went to make a purchase and got declined so logged in the app and the notes told me my account details weren't the same as the order details so I clicked the option to update them the screen just freezes, I contacted customer services three times to fix it the first ended the chat, the second kept messaging me say he will help me but never did after 15mins waiting in chat I ended it. The third told me I had to call round all the UK credit reference agencies and tell them my new address. So I gave up and asked her to close my accounts to my surprise she was more than happy to do with speed. Very frustrating service.	April 20, 2023

1558	Declined for no reason and ruined my credit score	I have to use Klarna as part of the Samsung upgrade service when I renew my phone after 12 months. This time and for no reason at all that I can see, my application through Samsung was declined by Klarna and now I am stuck with a phone I do not want.I spoke to Klarna as to why my application was declined and was told by the advisor and assured that Klarna only performs a soft credit search and it would not affect and show on my credit score. I was also told to settle any balances i had from other purchases in Klarna and that should help my application.After paying off my account, I repeatedly applied for my new phone but again, got declined.This is now showing on my credit report as hard searches and due to the number of applications that they told me were soft searches, my credit score has been massively impacted.Massively disappointed as now stuck with a phone I do not want and my credit score is hugely impacted for at least 6 months!

1564	Charged twice and lost refund.	I got charged twice for a purchase that I had already paid for and then when trying to talk to customer service every single agent told me something different. I then requested a refund because I ended up paying £174 for a £87 purchase and was told I had to sort it with wilkos myself. I did and then went back to Klarna customer service after a week and one agent told me that I haven't paid at all, anothwr told me the refund was processed that day (17th) and today an agent told me it was processed on the 8th and that it's my job to contact my bank and that it's lost on their end. After I have received my refund I am deleting Klarna.	April 20, 2023
1565	Disappointing	I am disappointed how I have been treated by Klarna. Having purchased a nintendo Switch from a website called discground.com payment of £209.99 was taken immediately by Klarna. Suspicion was raised when I had no tracking order or confirmation of the product and the fact that money had been paid to a company called VBT sports. I did receive an email from discgrounds who said the product was damaged in transit and wouldn't be delivered. They said I should contact Klarna for a refund. Everyone I contact online chat I wait an hour and get the same copied and pasted nonsense about it being escalated to our senior team and that they take it all very seriously. Well you are right "it is my hard earned money" and as the company is likely to be fake and have made it clear that the product won't be delivered then you should be quickly refunding the customer. If you look at discground.com reviews you can see others are in the same boat. I would however like to add that after writing this review the issue has now been resolved which might make me consider using again	April 20, 2023

1567	Very bad for a purchaser	Very bad for a purchaser . I paid fully for product on a website to which klarna supports the store. No product was supplied and this has made a dispute with the store. The store are not actioning what they need to, klarna are doing nothing to get my money back without the supplier input. So neither are bothered about me! Please be very wary of using Klarna as they are not focused on refunds and do not press the stores they let use their service.Great reply, already done all that! Chap was useful especially when your operator ends it part way through! The other side will do nothing, neither will you without them. Why don't you just ask them, both of you should stop hiding and deal with things.Now the 24th still no refund and waited 90 to chat with CS, nothing done yet!!	April 20, 2023
1568	Great app	Great app.  I love shopping through Klarna.  I find excellent deals and can break the payment down to 4 easy installments.  I love all the store options too.	April 20, 2023

1577	Love Klarna for big purchases	This is an easy and helpful option when needed to buy a bigger purchase such as a car seat or new tv!	April 19, 2023
1578	The system has made a decision.	Missed 3 payments. My fault. I accept as I simply neglected to update my debit card. Called to make it right by paying the past 3 months but they demanded I pay the entire 16 remaining months or it was going to a collection agency. Begged them and the customer service team, one on chat and one on the phone, but both said "The system has made a decision to send to a collection agency and there's nothing we can do." This even though they said it had to be paid in the next 5 days. What a joke! Apparently they and the customer serve the system? It's an excuse and a terrible practice of this company. Will NEVER use them again. Paid the entire outstanding bill to avoid the collection agency bit but learned a hard lesson. On the chat I was having, they deleted that phrase "The system has made a decision" so I couldn't screenshot it. Avoid klarna like the plague. They do not care about customers. Worst creditor ever.

1594	I recently used Klarna's payment system…	I recently used Klarna's payment system to process transactions for my business, and I was disappointed to find that the company does not offer adequate support for merchants. Despite their promises of merchant protection, I found that they prioritize customer satisfaction over that of the merchants who use their platform.I faced several issues where customers claimed they didn't receive the product, or it was damaged, and Klarna offered easy refunds without proper verification or investigation. This meant that I had to bear the cost of the product and the shipping, and I was left without any recourse to protect my business. When I tried to contact Klarna's support team for assistance, I found that they were unresponsive and not helpful.Overall, I found that Klarna's payment system is not well-suited for small businesses, and their lack of merchant protection and support makes it difficult to trust their platform. As a result, I will not be using Klarna for my business transactions in the future.	April 18, 2023

Been told to delete Klarna App and re instal, done this still no help. Anyone had the same problem and can help? When your report states no CCJ, bankruptcy etc why am I being declined and no one will look into it for me. I sent a review into Trustpilot a couple of weeks ago and till got nowhere.	April 19, 2023

1619	Just say NO to Klarna.	Just say no to Klarna.Of course it’s nice to have the thing you want now. But buying stuff you don’t actually NEED should be done in a way that protects you of things go wrong or you change your mind. Using Klarna leaves you at the mercy of their awful customer service and terrible returns and refunds process. Do yourself a favour, save up for it or use a credit card to pay. You might have one or two half decent purchase experiences using Klarna, but eventually you’ll have problems and Klarna will be less than helpful. What they don’t seem to understand is that people who need to buy stuff on credit, can’t afford to wait forever to get their money back. They trust the retailer enough to pay them all the money due, but as a customer they treat you with contempt. Avoid them at any cost.	April 19, 2023

1621	So tired of this app already	I’ve used Klarna for awhile already and yes it’s convenient at times but it has way more cons and pros. First the rewards when they had the original rewards where they were able to give $5, $10, $15 as a reward for your store of choice that was great then it’s changed and rewards that no one wants after they removed Amazon. Second the return process is horrendous, one two occasions I return items directly to the store I bought it from and come to find out I never received my fund back because Klarna thought I was probably stealing because it was under investigation. After they reviewed it completed they figured out that it was a Apple Pay issue and I’m still waiting for my funds to be returned… smh I’m so tired of this app that I stopped recommending anyone to use Klarna.

1630	Klarna is a great company!!!!	Klarna is a great company. It has enabled me to purchase major household items and affordably pay for them. If you are a person who pays your bills you will be fine. I’ve paid off three loans so far. Today I purchased a freezer I desperately need to take advantage of sales on food  and a 70” tv. Our current tv is 32”. The largest we’ve ever owned. Lol. We aren’t exactly big spenders. But we decided the price was great and we could finally afford one. Also my eyesight made it impossible to see the small tv any longer.  Lol. Credit is a godsend to regular folks who are happy to pay some interest in exchange for having what they need in an affordable way. I’m grateful.	April 19, 2023

I'm a good customer. I love to spread the cost and yet the last two times klarna has not recognised mine or my partners number which makes logging in an absolute nightmare, having to remember the email password I used then once logged in despite having more than adequate funds in my account my card was declined!I don't know what's going on but this is really taking the enjoyment out of buying things for me. In the end I used another company to pay and spread the cost with might I add no issues with the said card or phone number. Please sort these issues out for your regular customers before they give up using klarna all together.	April 18, 2023
1658	Klarna is a wonderful resource	Klarna is a wonderful resource, I have ADHD and credit cards can be very problematic for me in accidentally accruing debt.

1682	Every since I fell behind on my past…	Every since I fell behind on my past payments when I was off work because I got hurt on the job Klarna always wants me to pay half of the total up front. I don’t think I should have to keep being punished for getting behind on my payments when I was hurt. I have paid all my orders off since then and I still try to use this app. I’m just disappointed that something that was out of my control has caused me to have bad credit with Klarna.	April 17, 2023

1694	Is wonderful app		April 17, 2023
1695	BEWARE: Klarna is a scam.	Pray you never need a refund. Klarna will hold your money hostage for days or weeks after you’ve returned your item. The retailer will acknowledge your return to you by email and Klarna will still hold on to your money. If you complain or leave a bad review, they respond with passive aggressive replies blaming you for not following procedures or providing information (even when you do). Or they’ll reply saying they care about what happened to you but offer nothing beyond asking you to waste more time dealing with their customer service agents. Having the thing you want now is a great feeling. But it’s nowhere near as good as getting your money back when you want it. Using Klarna strips away your consumer rights. Just use your credit card instead. Klarna are just financial and societal vampires.	April 17, 2023

1712	Easy and fast	They are super fair and easy to make payments	April 17, 2023
1713	Duplicate Transaction	I purchased a resale ticket with Ticketmaster through Klarna and was double charged for my order. I immediately disputed the second charge with both Klarna and Ticketmaster but both companies told me they were not responsible, and to contact the other company. Klarna received multiple confirmations that Ticketmaster voided the first transaction and refused to refund me for the invalid charge. I've complained to BBB, CFPB, my credit card company, and now Trustpilot. Haven't had my issue resolved yet.	April 06, 2023

1725	Misrepresentation	ill-advised my Klarna who tell me a one time card I purchased and used was not processed, and I should purchase another one to complete an order. Guess what, you got it, now been charged £190 for a £95 order!!! Submitted all the relevant documentation to progress a complaint yet their procedure is convoluted, time consuming, and not what I would expect from a financial company. You need to close this out to my satisfaction, and put the right measures in place by training your staff. This is NOT on.	April 11, 2023
1726	False advertising! Don't bother	False advertising! They have been pushing their "referral scheme" via multiple emails and notifications, stating you can get vouchers for referring. I did this, met the criteria, yet weeks later and multiple emails to their customer service team still nothing. They keep asking the same questions on the 10 point criteria which isn't even stated on the app, yet refuse to issue. Will be deleting the app, it's not worth the trouble.Their phone lines are always closed (and have been tagged as Spam) and the link on their website for complaints doesn't even work! Very dodgy. Don't use!!!	April 13, 2023
1727	Helps when you dont have it at the time	My daughter needed clothes and i don't get paid until the 1st of next month and Klarna made it possible to get the stuff she needed without having to wait weeks!	April 14, 2023

1742	Avoid: Just want people who will default	What a joke, I have quite a bit of money in the bank and a steady income and hardly any outgoings yet I got declined for a £275 phone from giffgaff. Yes I could buy it out right but why when there is a zero intrest option.My mam also tried who had no issues getting a £18000 car loan and has a healthy bank account with regular income and also got rejected, no idea what the criteria with these are, just avoid save yourself the time and hassle.I guess Klarna will come back with their automated “Every transaction is assessed individually ect ect” but as stated above if banks and car places trust us with money who knows what standard these have, guess they only want people they think will default on their payments so they can inforce extra costs and kick interest in	April 16, 2023

1748	No Purchase Power for MONTHSSSSS	The app continuously tell me that I have no purchase power. I made all the payments on time and still haven’t seen a change. When I look up how to get purchase power, I’m told I can’t speak to anyone about it. Seems like you want me to use your competitor 🤷🏾‍♀️	April 16, 2023

1750	I used to be an avid fan of Klarna and…	I used to be an avid fan of Klarna and used it regularly when I was on a low wage (30K a year). This was quite a low period in my life where I would spend a lot of money on clothes and accessories (I work in the fashion industry for the biggest brands) to ensure I looked the part. It’s fair to say I would spend much more than what I could afford and I was fine with that because I had “Klarna”. The buy now and pay later scheme appealed and worked brilliantly for me. I would time my purchases around pay day so I could pay off my debt straight away. I was living pay cheque to pay cheque, not to pay bills but to look a certain way… crazy I know. Fast forward 5/6 years down the line, I am now earning SIGNIFICANTLY way more money than I was before and can ACTUALLY afford the finer things in life without having a dependency on Klarna and I absolutely love it. In the midst of this, I feel like I must’ve angered or betrayed Klarna because now they refuse to allow me to use their product. This makes 0 sense to me. 0. Sense. They rather support a young person, barely making ends meet, spending unhealthy, non-responsibly and sensibly over an Adult who is in a financially good position. I agree I do not need to use Klarna and maybe there isn’t many grounds for me to moan but I can’t help but feel sad for all of those people who find themselves in a similar trap to the old me. It’s clear they want a certain audience and that’s fine but please don’t portray yourself to be ethical when you’re not. My advice, stay far away unless you want to support an organisation that promotes people to spend more than they can afford. If you really like something, save and pay, it’s the best way.(For those questioning why I was trying to use Klarna, it’s only because if you’re unsure about an item and will most likely return it’s just easier to do it with Klarna as you have no money leave your accounts and having to wait for a refund to process.).	April 16, 2023
1751	The best thing since slice bread😁		March 14, 2023
1752	DO NOT USE THIS APP!!	DO NOT USE THIS APP!!! I've never had issues buying paying back klarna in nthe past. I have an open complaint purchase return from this horrible merchant no refund for almost 1 year now klarna will not resolve. Instead of refunding my money klarna is threatening collections. I will seek legal action against klarna if this is the route the want to go with this issue	July 15, 2022

1757	Useless service	1. Cannot reset phone number as they ask to upload photos of passport or driving license. When I uploaded my passport they did not accepted it as it is Polish Passport and now they are asking for British one... I do not have a British passport ! No do I have a driving license. Therefore I am unable to reset the phone. USELESS.2. I used klarna once maybe twice and always paid on time, I have great credit score, no debts etc. yet cannot use klarna anymore as they decline to give me service. Have no issue getting other providers though. When asked Klarna for explanation they weren't able to tell. No prob then, will take my business somewhere else.3. I believe they just had data leak as I have received message from my bank asking to verify purchase for klarna, purchase that I didn't do as I am no longer using their services. When I tried to login and delete my old account, guess what? See 1st point - cannot reset phone number to receive login verification. I am now sending official letter to them in order to withdraw all the data they can hold on me, I am no longer interested having account with them.	April 16, 2023

I wrote to Assos, they replied that I should ask Klarna, Klarna replied that the amount was refunded, and I still do not have a transfer from August 2022.

I love the option of using my Klarna card at the physical store and being able to split the purchase into four payments. Using Klarna is a great way to shop and build your credit with them. I have seen my purchase power go up from around $200 to almost $1,500 in the past year with making sure that my payments are never late and never spending more than I can afford to pay back.

Upon checking I found that my credit is not good enough and I got experian alert of a credit search. With utter disgust I called Klarna and customer service advisor told that it's a new rule for every purchase there would be a soft credit search. Which makes me think to stop using their service.

However that program has come and gone it seems. Well here comes Klarna to the rescue. I was approved the night of purchase. My ps5 was shipped the next day and had it the following. See this was much better than layaway, I was able to game it up while paying on my PS5. My payments were very manageable at less the $50. Well I had knocked it down to about half and just paid the rest off. They knocked off enough projected interest I was happy. I would definitely recommend, and I may even do the same to pick up a Psvr2.	April 13, 2023

1925	I had the Klarna credit card for at…	I had the Klarna credit card for at least 6 months never missed payment and always stayed current. They reduced my purchase power drastically without warning and I pulled my credit report and they check my credit score it appears weekly. This card offers no perks and you pay $4.99 a month to use and you make payments every two weeks. I feel like this card has hurt my credit and the formula or AI they using for calculating is way off. After my balance is paid I’m not using the card anymore it’s intrusive with no benefits and customer service is basically copying pasting messages.	April 09, 2023

1929	Happy Customer	Klarna has made it possible to grab items that were time sensitive but funds were limited. They are extremely flexible in repayments and returns. I use them regularly and love the ease they provide.	April 13, 2023
1930	incredible app experience	incredible app experiencesearching and compare feature - meant i saved £50 on trainders - thank you klarna	April 01, 2023
1931	Pathetic services	Pathetic services. No customer services. They investigated any issues properly and come to resolution without looking at facts. Do use them because they won't help if you get any problems with the supplier...avoid at all cost	April 13, 2023
1932	Very great and easy to use		April 13, 2023
1933	Helps keep financially responsible	Offers so many places to shop, helps keep you responsible with spending	February 08, 2023
1934	Ease of use is good	Love being able to shop at any site entered.  Could use a little decluttering in the options…too much on first page.	April 13, 2023
1935	Nobody will give you answers if something goes wrong	I was a regular user. I will never use klarna again.Here's some context; I made a purchase with Klarna for a pair of sneakers that cost about 100 euros, divided into 3 payments.The first 3 payments were made without any problems.Without making any changes to the linked card, the third payment failed. Then I received an email notifying me of the rejected payment. So I tried to pay the outstanding debt again and again, and again.I authorized the payment with the bank, however, the klarna system continually showed a message that the payment had failed again without any further explanation.I repeated this same process several times over two weeks, even asking for help from customer service, and was not offered a solution.Now the due date for the last payment has expired, and I have been charged a late fee, and on top of that, they have sent my case to a debt collection agency. I have been trying for 3 weeks to pay with the same card that they have charged twice. I have spent multiple hours of my life talking to customer service to explain my case over and over again.The worst part is that now klarna says they can't do anything to solve it because they have already sent the case to the debt collection agency - a case they sent because of their system error -  and now I have to wait for the debt collection agency to contact me (I called them for the second time this morning, and they know nothing about my case).Furthermore, a chat agent tells me that they will remove the late fee because recognising that through no fault of my own the last payment was rejected. The next time we talk the agent tells me they can't remove the fee and claim zero responsibility for it.Needless to say, Klarna is a smart business model that can ease the pain of paying. Just make sure that nothing at all, in the slightest goes wrong. If it does, you'll waste a significant number of hours sorting it out. Also, pay zero attention to the community manager that's going to enthusiastically jump on here and give me the contact info for customer service so they can eagerly solve my problems. They won't solve anything. They'll most likely tell you what they told me, "Just be patient"	April 13, 2023

1948	Block Orders	Not good customer service. All my orders gets canceled and says that they can’t verify my address for the past few months. Contacted customer service and they checked my account multiple times and see that there is no problem whatsoever with my account and that I must figure it out on my own. In conclusion they don’t allow me to use their services despite having my names/address and such match my bank but orders get canceled and I have to figure it out own my own	April 13, 2023

1958	Having the ability to pay in…	Having the ability to pay in installments makes the purchase decision an easier one.  Wanted a hoodie I found on Amazon and bought with Klarna.  Don’t know why Amazon makes you get a ‘gift card’ where it didn’t before while using Klarna but it works	March 30, 2023

1980	I absolutely love Klarna	I absolutely love Klarna. I completely trust this company. They're easy to handle and understand just straight through the app for what it is: pay in 4, online or in store. Oh wow, no complaints. They've managed to be by my side at the pet hospital, the auto shop and tire shop. I was sold on the physical card because REAL LIFE HAPPENS. I'm not loaded with fees. I've missed one payment on my card when my dog died and they combined it with the next. Understand, like all financial institutes, they didn't have to do that, they could have cut my line and asked for the balance in full. I'm very actively checking my app and offering up early payments and it just keeps building my line. Klarna has helped me with rent, acting as a credit card. Not every time you want to use Klarna will it work, it's a two way street, the place you're shopping must recognize Webbank. No attack on my credit. Super recommend if you're not a risky financer.

1987	klarna is the Goat	klarna is the Goat! when your in a pinch or just dont wanna pay full price at that moment it gives you that option to break it up. it has really helped me out. An unlike other similar apps... klarna leta you use it on any website bot just the shops on the app. its really amazing. the only thing that sicks is it takes a while for them to boost your amount but i understand they have to be sure your making your payments an on time etc. but overall they're Awesome!!!	April 01, 2023
1988	Super flexible, reliable and easy	Honestly my go-to app overall for anything I need. From clothing, beusyt, home and appliances, travel, etcDo not hesitate to download and create an account.	April 12, 2023

1995	Option to use removed for no reason	Looks like i'm having the same issues as others.  Used Klarna a few times previously and I like the option when shopping, never had an issue and never missed a payment but i'm now being declined for missed or overdue payments (account is £0) I've settled every purchase early so not sure if this is a factor as they don't make money from late fees. I have a 999/999 credit rating on Experian and no issues so I spoke with customer services as I was concerned something may show up on my credit report.  They confirmed all is in order, they have no idea why it would happen and there is also nothing they can do. The generic responsible lending reply is not necessary as it doesn't apply in this circumstance.  App will be deleted as now pointless.	April 12, 2023
1996	Klarna stay clear	Dont touch klarna anymore ,as i had a problem with a item i bought through klarna ...faulty goods i bought the merchandise company excepted responsibility of the item ,they then said that they would get me my money back .I explained to the company as i waited over 6 weeks for the item i paused my payment to them they said ok no problem i also asked the company if they wanted there faulty goods returned they gave me no feed back in this so as far as i was concerned the issue was closed. Yet 4 months later Klarna still wants me to send money to the company who have closed the issue  ..Klarna is farsical dont give a crap about what customers tell them ...even with proof so it just shows how much this company gives a crap about customers using there services in general ...stay away 1 out of 10 and thats been generous. A reply to your answer :ive sent numerous letters to your complaints department with proof of the company involved stating they at fault your complaints department as ignored this and not once have contacted the company involved ...which you do say you do ,but obviously this has not happened ?so keep sending your replies to me on trustpilot i have the evidence that you as a company dont intervene and resolve problems when they arrise ....

1998	Klarna Card	I’ve used my Klarna Card regularly over the past few months. I’ve always paid on time or early. Each time I pay, my ‘purchase power’ is adjusted within 24hours. Happy days…. Until now. I decided to pay all my purchases in one hit on the 28th March. Big mistake. The payments were then scheduled to be taken on the 31st March so my purchase power did not revert back straight away. They eventually cleared on the 4th April. It’s now the 12th and my purchase power has still not been reset. I have spoken to 3 different agents on chat and am constantly told to wait 72 hours because it takes longer when you pay all together. What a load of nonsense. What’s the point in suing on time or early if you get penalised. Poor show 🤬	April 12, 2023
1999	klarna is amazing!	it is really easy to work with Klarna and for  a tech disaater like me , thats really amazing!	April 12, 2023
